In January 2020, Engr. Greg fell sick and died due to the Corona-virus pandemic.\nSince then I have made several inquiries in the Embassy to locate any of my client's extended relatives but all efforts were unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you and solicit your assistance as a foreigner because you bear the same last name .To execute the claim of his Estate Which includes cash deposits.\nI have contacted you to assist in repatriating the assets and Capital valued at US$9.8 million Dollars (Nine Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) left behind by my client before they get\nconfiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. The said bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next month.\nSince I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives.  I seek the consent to present you as the Next of kin to the deceased. The request of a foreigner as the next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that my client was a foreigner and the money cannot be paid into a local bank here, so it will be better for you to stand as the next of kin to my client. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer. I have all necessary information\nand legal documents needed to back you up for claim.\nAll I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us to see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. \nBest Regards,\nBarr. Thomas Miguel  Luis   \n",

GLIBERT is a nationality of the United\nStates of America. I am married to MR.GLIBERT ANTHONY who worked with\nKuwait Petroleum Corporation in the United Kingdom for nine years\nbefore he died in the year 2014. We were married for eleven years\nwithout a child; he died after a brief illness that lasted for only\nfour days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.\nWhen my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of $18.5 million\n(Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a BANK in\nEurope Presently, this money is still with the BANK. Recently, my\nDoctor told me that I would not last for the next one or two months\ndue to a long term cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my\nstroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to\nchurch or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this\nmoney the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to use this\nfund for churches, orphanages, Research centers and widows propagating\nto the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.\nThe Bible made us understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I\ntook this bold decision because I don\u2019t have any child that will\ninherit this money and my husband\u2019s relatives are not Christians and I\ndon\u2019t want my family's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.\nI don\u2019t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly\nmanner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.\nI am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I\nam going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the\nlord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things\nare possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall detail you more\nand I will give the contact of the BANK as soon as I am sure that you\nwill do the will of God. I will also issue you a letter of authority\nthat will empower you as the new beneficiary of this Fund. I want you\nto always pray for me because the lord is my Shepherd. My happiness is\nthat I lived the life of a worthy Christian.\nWhoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and\ntruth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in\nyour reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian\nindividual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act\naccordingly as I stated here.\nHoping to hear from you soon!\nRemain blessed in the name of the Lord.\nYours-in-Christ,\nMrs. Elizabeth J ANTHONY.\nEmail; (\nmrssisterelizabethjohnsonmrssi@gmail.com\n)  \n",

I am a Citizen of United states of America (U.S.A) I am married to, late Mr.George.Adams.Robinson,Who was a small gold company owner. My late husband died on an airline crash, in the year February 2010, During his lifetime he deposited the sum of ($11,000,000.00 Dollars).In the bank  The money was from the sale of his company and death benefits payment and entitlements of my late husband by his company. I am sending you this message with heavy tears in my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, and also praying that it will reach you in good health because I am not in good health, I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am suffering from long time cancer and presently I am partially suffering from Leprosy, which has become difficult for me to move around. I was married to my late husband for more than 6 years without having a child. And my doctor just confirmed to me that I have less chance to live, having to know when the cup of death will come, I decided to contact you to claim the fund since I don't have any relation.I grew up from an orphanage home, I have decided to donate this money for the support of helping Motherless babies, Less privileged/Widows and churches also to build the house of God because I am dying and diagnosed with cancer for about 3 years ago. I have decided to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you, for the good work of Almighty God. I will be going in for an operation surgery soon,Now I want you to stand as my next of kin to claim the funds for charity purposes. Because if this money remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for selfishness and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools and churches for less privilege that will be named after my late husband and my name. Please I'm waiting for your prompt response if only you are interested. I will send you further details and the bank contact details where the fund has been deposited for you to contact the Bank for immediate release and transfer of the fund into your bank account as my rightful beneficiary.\nRespectfully,Mrs,Alice,Robinson,\nWritten from the Hospital.   \n",

It was discovered that your name, identity, and email were currently used to transfer and invest the total sum of $51,000,000.00 in the Settlement Bank of United States and the dividend currently running up to $ 15,000,000.00. We have all the document here to confirm this claim\n    Now the questions are, how can a dead man be actively involved in fund investment without the presence of the next of kin who is supposed to be the signatory?  Secondly, could this lawyer be trying to play a smart one? and lastly but not the least, This office has not at any time been notified either by email or letter by any medical practitioner certifying your deceased state or any document issued by any member of your family or from a registrar of vital statistics that declares the date, location, and cause of your death.\nWe have tried severally to reach-out to you by sending emails to your address and several attempted calls made, but all have so far proved abortive, hence this office is left with no other option than to send this reminder message to your email ones again, as we would not accept to be held liable for any loss of your rights and fund to a wrong person. If you are still alive, do respond with your form of identification for final confirmation without delays, as we have already informed the bank that the real beneficiary of the fund may likely still be alive without even realizing what the lawyer whom so much was entrusted to have been up to.\nBest Regards,\nAnderson Noah, For,\nMr. J\u00fcrgen Stock,\nNew Secretary-General of the International\nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL)   \n",

I hope with this explanation\nyou will understand better my purpose of contacting you please read\ncarefully and patiently.\nIn June 2015, one of our foreign customers made a Fixed deposit for 36\ncalendar months, valued at US$35,500,000.00 in our bank where l am head of\naccounts department.\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but\ngot no reply. After waiting several months, we sent a reminder and finally\ndiscovered from his contract employers that he and his family died in a\nplane crash.\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a WILL\nand all attempts to trace extended members of his family were never\nsuccessful. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he\ndid not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents\nin his Bank Deposit paperwork at my Bank.\nHis money (US$35,000,000.00 ) has been floating as unclaimed since maturity\nand all efforts to get his relatives have proved unsuccessful. According to\nour banking policy, if such money continues to remain unclaimed, the money\nwill be passed to the coffers of the Central bank treasury unclaimed bill.\nIt's been many years now and nobody has shown up for the money. My proposal\nto you is that l want you to cooperate with me to enable us to claim the\nmoney so we can both use it for investment . I will put all the necessary\ndocuments together to make you the next of kin so that the money will be\npaid to you. I have secured from the probate court an order of mandamus to\nlocate any family member of the deceased so that the money can be paid to\nhim or her, but still no success.\nIf you agree to cooperate with me, after successful execution of this deal,\nwe shall share the money in percentage of 50/50. I assure you that this\ndeal is 100% risk free, you don't have to fear anything as l am a\nprofessional in Real Estate Banking / Family Wealth\nIf you are interested in engaging in this deal, please respond in earliest\nupon reception of this message so I can confidently explain to you more\nThank you.\nSincerely yours,\nJJ Kwame.\n",

I will guide you through the\nprobate application and the only thing that can fuck this deal is if at any\npoint during the claim process you open up to somebody and my bank gets to\nknow that you are not related to the deceased depositor.\nThat will not only ruin my career but might as well earn me some jail time\nfor misrepresentation/falsification of information to defraud the bank.\nOther than that, if you agree to work with me and keep this transaction\nconfidential, we can claim these funds in less than 10 banking days if you\nfollow instructions and do as I tell you. So, for a start, you have to give\nme your full details;\n* Full name\n* Age or Date of birth\n* Occupation\n* Address\n* Telephone number\nThe process is simple, it starts with a false alarm to my colleagues that a\nrelative of the deceased contacted me and I have asked you to send an\nemail.

I'm Mrs Maria Bouchard. And an aging widow suffering from a long Cancer illness. I have some funds that I inherited from my deceased husband, the amount (15.6 million. Dollars). And I needed a very honest and sincere person, an individual or cooperating organization that would use this foundation for the work of humanity,\nI want you to take 40% of the total amount of money for personal use. While 60% of the money goes to charity \"people on the street and to help the orphanage. I grew up as an orphan, and I have no one, like my family member, just to save the house of God. I do this in order so that God will forgive my sins and take my soul because these diseases have suffered me so much, My late husband made me realize that it is good to remember and shelter the poor  and the needy ones, He saw me that day when he came, to visit the Orphanage home at Canton Zurich Switzerland and asked for my hand in marriage, I have to follow his steps and help the needy,\nI do not want a situation where this money will not be used in a Godly way. That is why I make this decision. I'm not afraid of death, so I know where I'm going. I know that I will be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that \"the lord will fight my case, and I will be silent.\" I do not need any telephone communication in this regard due to the state of my health and the presence of relatives of my late husband around me, always trying to get this money from me, which my husband left for me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God's help all things are possible.\nI found your email address in the personnel department database and decided to contact you. Please, if you can use the tools for the work of humanity, as I said here. To fulfill my late husband and my wish please\nTry checking the spam box, because most of these matches sometimes fall in the SPAM folder.\nPlease reply to me immediately via this my personal email address for security reasons.\nThank you.\nBest wishes,\nMaria Bouchard  \n",

I came across your contact via the World Trade Center (W.T.C.)   African Regional office , without disclosure of my intentions which is personal.\nAs an authority here in Niger Delta Development Commission, I noticed  three executed contracts which have not been paid for and the contractors who executed these contracts could not be traced or reached  till this moment.Upon my resumption in the office, I called for internal auditing after hand over, I realized  so many  financial lapses involving   huge  contract sum  amounting to Forty Million , Six Hundred and Fourteen Thousand United States of America Dollars (US$40,614,000 Million), Twenty One Million United States of America Dollars (UDS$21 Million ) and Ten Million, Five Hundred  Thousand (US$10,500,000)  respectively.\nI further investigated to find out that these  funds were products of over invoicing  from contractors / companies whom  actually and genuinely were awarded  contracts respectively and they  executed the jobs and were duly paid  with Job completion certificates issued ,but my predecessors  could not move the left over  funds  due to\nunexpected call for their resignation/ removal from the office ( WRONG TIMING).  Since their resignation,Some of them have  secretly and personally approached me  to cover  these transactions  for them by not disclosing to anyone or leave it in the  NDDC accounts/ records  in order not to implicate them, rather , i should  protect their image and   secure these funds for me and my cabinets as these funds have been there and cannot be declared to the Government , if disclosed, some higher authorities  will find ways to  claim it. I have recently discussed  and agreed with the Executive Project Director, Chief Accountant and  Financial Director  to secure and move this fund outside the country .\nHowever, we further noticed that the  companies used in securing these funds respectively were neither  incorporated  as a legal entity with the Corporate Affairs Commission nor registered with Niger Delta Development Commission as contractors, making it difficult to neither function in business nor authorize for contract payment.\nI am fully aware of the activities of some unscrupulous people that are currently going on in our world today which you must have been fully acquainted with unpleasant stories, especially this part. But the truth also remains that the world has not been totally invaded by this group of people hence, people can still do businesses together all over the world and further establish healthier personal and business relationships.\nHaving explained this , I seek your consent to partner with  us and  secure this fund in your name or company's name. All documents shall be legally provided to suit the purpose . As the Chairman/CEO of Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC), I cannot risk or gamble with my position. There is no risk whatsoever attached. We will award you with 15% of any secured funds with you and our shares shall  also be invested with you in your country pending when our tenure in the office will elapse .\nKindly get back to me  with your Full name and telephone / mobile number for more details \nif agreed to work with us.Also, I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law.\nThank you.\nYours faithfully,\nDr Samuel Ogboku.\n",

Also, I would like to know more about the legalities of moving the funds outside the country. \nI am interested in learning more about this opportunity, but I would like to proceed with caution.

How are you and members of your family? I hope this finds you all well.\nI am Mr. Joseph Scott, the Senior Operations Manager, Bank of America and I am contacting you based on my capacity as the officer in charge in respect of the will left in your name by late Mr. Andersen, whose demise occurred on the 26th April 2021. He was a customer in my bank (Bank Of America) and he (late Mr. Andersen) deposited the sum of US$5M in my bank in the year 2013 and i have the photocopies of his fund's documents and will send it to you via email attachment to apply to my bank as the next of kin to the deceased person.\nLate Mr. Andersen,  lived in Scotland. Just like I had feared, my efforts to trace his family members were unsuccessful since there was inadequate or rather, no information left by him about his family members. For two years (from 2021 till now). I have invested both time and money in my quest to trace his family tree but all my efforts have been futile.\nMy resolving to engage this measure to secure the notice from my bank in June 2023 that they will be effecting confiscation action on his account if there is non-appearance of a beneficiary before the end of June 2023. As a matter of fact, banking policy governing suspended accounts empowers the bank to confiscate his funds and remit it as residual to the government deposit account after 5 to 10 years as unclaimed or owner-less funds.\nYou may or may not be related to Mr. Andersen. However, that is my least concern at the moment. I have contacted you because you share the same last name with him and my intention is to present you to the bank as the bona fide beneficiary to his account after procuring and obtaining due legal documentation in the Courts.\nYou may be wondering how I would be able to fortify and consummate this deal but make no mistake; I have not insinuated that achieving this objective will be easy and simple. But all I can assure you is that with a proper and careful handling that we will come out successful.\nPrior to sending you this email I have planned how best to execute this transaction and trust me, you can count on my proficiency.

I\nintended to keep the money for my adopted child but unfortunately, my\nadopted child got involved in a bus accident while returning back from\nschool and he died. I finally made up my mind to donate out this fund\nafter being diagnosed of cancer by my doctor. That was few months ago.\nRecently, my doctor insisted that I must go for surgical operation, or\nelse, it would get to uncontrollable stage. He also made me to\nunderstand that my chances of surviving the operation would be 50/50\nand that the surgery operation must be done. Based on that, I decided\nthat I have to WILL off the fund to the suffering children first\nbefore going for the operation\nIn view of the above, I want you to assure me that you are going to\nutilize this money that I am about to entrust in your care, that the\nmoney would not be used in some other things that are not in line with\nwhat I have proposed for the money. Please, I want you to write back\nto me and acknowledge to me that the money must be used judiciously.\nOnce I receive your response to this message, and if your vision\ntowards this project is acceptable with me, I shall then put you in\ncontact with my late husband\u2019s lawyer who is going to work hand in\nhand with you for transfer of the money to you, because i may not be\nable to communicate again once am placed on medical supervision for my\noperation.

        "inbound": "Hello William.\nIt is a pleasure to be in contact with you and I wouldn't want us to do \nemails back and forth without making real progress especially when you \nhave refused to disclose your identity. I hope you understand we cannot \nclose this deal without knowing whom we are negotiating with.\nI will  liaise with you on the procedure of applying for and receiving a \npotential loan. Given the  nature of your project, we can only decide on \nthe level of our participation/ finance after we receive an executive \nsummary of your project. In order not to waste our times, I will give \nyou  some basic information on the general outline of the process.\nThe principle terms for the loan procedure are as follows: -\nSecuritization:         Via Insurance Bond Guarantee (cost 3% of loan \namount and can be agreed to be deducted from loan prior to disbursement \n- see below)\nEst. Length of Loan:                         10 years + (TBC)\nMoratorium on Interest:               0 to 36 months possible\nRepayment:                                 At end of loan period\n(which can be extended by mutual agreement) or pay back early the amount\nof the Loan in minimum tranches of USD 500,000 without penalty.\nInterest Rate:                                    2.5% per annum\nLegal Jurisdiction:                             International\nRegarding the Insurance Bond Guarantee - no other collateral, personal \nguarantee of share pledge is required. The Insurance Bond is put in \nplace as the surety / security for the loan. In the instance (after \n\"default notification\" and \"failure to remedy\") that a loan could \npotentially fully default the Insurance Bond is triggered in favor of \nthe lender and pays back the majority of their loan. For the balance \nthere is then a company valuation done on the Borrowers and Lender can \ntrigger step-in rights for a proportion of the company shares. But this \nis a last resort always. The one off cost is 3% of the loan and is \ndeducted from the loan amount and not required to be provided separately \nby the Borrower.\nAs with all lenders there are some fees ahead of drawdown that cannot be \navoided or deferred. These will be outlined in the lenders Procedure \ndocument and indicatively they will be: -\no             Flat fee for legal and administration following loan \napproval at Board Level.\no             Variable fee for completion and closing costs    To be \nconfirmed\nKindly get back to me with the executive summary of your proposal if \nthese terms fit into the purview of your search for viable financing so \nwe can proceed with the loan process.\nI look forward to discussing with you further.\nBest regards,\nJeff Newton\n",

In fact, since his death, no next of kin of the\naccount holder nor any relative of him has shown up for the claim of\nthis fund, this is because he has the account as a secret account\nthus, he left all the documents for the deposit with me as his account\nofficer and financial advisory.\nThis is where I am interested and where I want you to come in, I want\nyou to come in as a relative of the deceased; do not bother that you\nare not in any way related to him because I am in position to affix\nyour name as the next of kin to the deceased and no one will question\nit since I am the officer in charge of the account.

So, I'm contacting you to stand as my husband to claim\nthis fund on my behalf even if you are already married you can still\nhelp me by standing as my husband to the deposited funds.\nPlease remember that I am writing you this email purely on the ground\nof trust so we can achieve this deal together.

Please read carefully and patiently.\nIn June 2015, one of our foreign customers made a Fixed deposit for 36 calendar months, valued at US$35,500,000.00 in our bank where l am head of accounts department.\nUpon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After waiting several months, we sent a reminder and finally discovered from his contract employers that he and his family died in a plane crash.\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a WILL and all attempts to trace extended members of his family were never successful. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents in his Bank Deposit paperwork at my Bank.\nHis money (US$35,500,000.00 ) has been floating as unclaimed since maturity and all efforts to get his relatives have proved unsuccessful. According to our banking policy, if such money continues to remain unclaimed, the money will be passed to the coffers of the Central bank treasury unclaimed bill.\nIt's been many years now and nobody has shown up for the money. My proposal to you is that l want you to cooperate with me to enable us to claim the money so we can both use it for investment . I will put all the necessary documents together to make you the next of kin so that the money will be paid to you. I have secured from the probate court an order of mandamus to locate any family member of the deceased so that the money can be paid to him or her, but still no success.\nIf you agree to cooperate with me, after successful execution of this deal, we shall share the money in percentage of 50/50. I assure you that this deal is 100% risk free, you don't have to fear anything as l am a professional in Real Estate Banking / Family Wealth\nIf you are interested in engaging in this deal, please respond in earliest upon reception of this message so I can confidently explain to you more\nThank you.\nSincerely yours,\nJean-Jacque Kwame\n",

I am interested in learning more, but I want to make sure everything is legitimate before moving forward.\nBest wishes,\nHilary\n",

        "inbound": "Dear Hilary\nThanks for your response and your readiness to work with me on this matter. First and foremost, let me reassure you, that this is a 100% legal transaction. People around the world claim on their late relatives estate on a daily basis and this is just one of such claims - only this time, you are not related with the deceased and working with a bank insider (me), who was the deceased account officer.\nI will provide you, with all relevant documents and guide you through the claim process and we share the funds at a 50/50 ratio after claim. I will guide you through the probate application and the only thing, that can fuck this deal is, if at any point during the claim process, you open up to somebody and my bank gets to know, that you are not related to the deceased depositor. That will not only ruin my career, but might as well earn me some jail time for misrepresentation/falsification of information, to defraud the bank. Other than that, if you agree to work with me, and keep this transaction confidential, we can claim these funds in less than 10 banking days, if you follow instructions and do as I tell you. So, for a start, you have to give me your full details:\n* Full name\n* Age or Date of birth\n* Occupation\n* Address\n* Telephone number/WhatsApp\nThe process is simple, it starts with a false alarm to my colleagues, that a relative of the deceased contacted me and I have asked you, to send an email. I will give you a text draft, that you will send to the appropriate Dept., once you send the email, I will check and find your name in our file, which I have already created with above details, which I will submit for approval. Then you go through probate, to get a letter of administration (I will guide you, on how to go about that) and submit it to the bank and direct them to transfer the funds to your designated bank account. The funds are currently in a suspense account with our bank Banque Atlantique Group, Abidjan.\nI will guide you with more details, when you reply to this mail. The only area, I might need your financial assistance is in the legal fees. We need a \"Letter of Administration\" from the Court\nand a lawyer is required, to file the \"Affidavit of Death\" to the Probate Court, to obtain the \"Letter of Administration\".\nThis will cost some money and that's the only area, I will be needing your assistance, which I am certain, that both of us can handle, without any difficulties. If you are ready and willing to proceed, please respond with the above details and please find my WhatsApp number below.\nRegards,\nJean-Jacque\n+2250170605230\n",

This is because our company is yet to locate any seller to buy from, however, I have been able to discover a local dealer who can supply us with this product. He is selling at a cheap rate , which is far more cheaper than our previous purchases.\nMy director is not yet aware that I have found a new seller. Now THIS IS MY PROPOSAL TO YOU; I want you to stand in as a new local dealer from your country and I will introduce you to our company. The reason for this is because I don't want my company to have direct contact with the local agent that sells this\u00a0 excipient very cheaply.\nThis will enable us to work together as partners and make real cool profits. You as the local seller will supply to our company at a good rate which I will inform you later when we are in agreement and This will attract the attention of our company director to buy from you as against the previous rate . You will be amazed with our total profit .\nI will give you more specific profit details when I receive feedback from you if you are interested.\nRegards\nPhilip Roger\n",

Without wasting much time, I have personally investigated this payment down to the Ministry where this contract was executed and from my findings it is clear that you did not execute this contract in question, from all available information, it looks like some officials in the Ministry were trying to use you to claim this particular value which they over invoiced for their own selfish interest. I know it might interest you to know how I managed to find out this truth, yes. I investigated this payment up to the ministry where this contract was executed and after some checks I was surprised to see that the most vital/important documents regarding this contract bear a different name and beneficiary.\nBased on this I decide to contact the supervisor that signed the attestation report, on getting to the contract award and supervisory commission I collected the contract attestation report and found out that this document still bears the name: B&B PETROLEUM ENG.PTY as the company that executed this contract. I kept this to myself and came down to my base. As a matter of fact I have been thinking if to report my findings to the appropriate body for cancellation of this payment, but I have this second thought of contacting you since I am not a saint and in a position to approve this payment for the president to give go ahead order to the release, I feel this might be a Gods given opportunity.\nSo based on this I am writing to you, if you will accept my  conditions I can normalize all the relevant papers of this payment and the funds will be released within 14 working days. Contract attestation report is not in your name, the fund ownership certificate is also not in your name. Actually your partners, as I should say, did a very great job in manipulating almost all the documents to your favor.\nNow, I want you to know that, with my position, I can amend this problem and this money will be paid to your nominated bank account which both of us will share on a 50/50 %if only you will accept my conditions. So, if you see it wise to get this perfected with me feel free.\nI shall let you know my conditions as soon as I hear from you.\nThanks.\nMary Egbu\nChairLady Payment Verification Panel\n",

The diplomat's inability to\npay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the\nconsignment is delayed and abandoned.\nBy my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They are\nstill left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments\nlike I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal\ndimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective Capacity: 680 L) Approximately.\nThe details of the consignment including your name and email on the\nofficial document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment\nwas tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with\nus. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your, Full name, Phone Number,\nfull address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on\nthe official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need\nthe consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK (place of origin) as\nwe were instructed.\nLike I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most\nimportantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the\nyellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s) etc. I\nam ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages\nprovided you will also give me something out of it (financial\ngratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services\nof a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary\nsecurity that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the\ndestination of your choice.

Today I found out through the Central computer database that they are about to re-route back your fund to a security company in the USA. With this, I felt that it is important for me to alert you on this development.\nThey are still using your name and contract/inheritance identification number as the beneficiary but they have changed the account co-ordinate and this is the reason they are frustrating you by asking for endless fees in order to buy time pending on when they will transfer your funds to their designated account in Cayman Islands.\nI have the reference number of the transaction and also I have the number of the official who is directly in charge at the SECURITY COMPANY in the USA.\nYour payment is supposed to go through the UK credit control financial clearing house before final Lodging into the security company there in the USA. All the data about your claim profile are within my reach. I do not need gratification from you either in cash or kind. I can never be a part of evil.\nPlease respect my discretion in this matter, you can send an email to me so that I can give you the reference number and the name and contact information of the official of the security company in the USA. I repeat, Please do not expose my personality, it is not easy to get jobs around here and I cannot contend with these powerful individuals because they can eliminate me just like that. reply to me through my private email (dennisbellofficial@aol.com) if you are interested in getting your long overdue payment.\nGod bless you.\nDennis Campbell.\n",

The essence of my reaching out to you is the fact that as a staff, it is against Sao Tome government operational ethics to profiteer from any dealings with any oil purchasing firm hence the reason I need a trustworthy middle person outside my work circle to stand as the oil AGENT or BROKER so we can get all the commission paid to us for all the oil purchases.\nI will guide you as an insider to obtain the required oil License certification from the National Petroleum Agency of Sao Tome and Principe (NPA-STP) .If you are interested to partner with me on this, we can achieve this license and registration with the NPA-STP in your name in less than 10 working days once the application is submitted. Worry less about purchases as I already have some firms who are ready to purchase oil but do not have any credible licensed agent to broker for them as required.\nAs soon as I hear from you today confirming your interest, I shall prepare and send to you a draft copy of the MOU between you and I before we can start the process of acquiring the Oil Agency/ Brokerage License.\nPlease ensure that you reply to this email address:  \ncsalvaterra0001@gmail.com\nThank you and Kind regards.\nEngr.

I will also\nbe very pleased to have you as a partner and wish to assure you that with\nyour cooperation, we will be able to complete this project in no time.\nAs i informed you, i am in possession of an existing oil lifting license\nfrom the island of Sao Tome and Principe which i can use my position in the\noil and gas company here to reallocate to your company's name or personal\nname since the original operator Mr. Kim from South Korea is dead. This\nlicense has been issued since 2007 and till now is still valid for use.\nThe only thing that is required from you is to have your company name or\npersonal name registered and paid for with the Sao Tome and Principe\ncorporate affairs commission as a P.L.P company specializing in oil lifting\nand with the certificate of company registration in your company name, i\nwill be able to reassign the license to your name or your company's name. I\nbelieve that since we are about to go into a long lasting business\nrelationship, we have to be sincere to each other to achieve the greater\ngoal. To this end, I have to inform you that the only fee that will be\nrequired in this venture will be the company registration fee to have your\ncompany name registered as a P.L.P company and where you are not in a\nposition to assist with the fee, I will get one of my friends to assist us\nwith the fee so that we will proceed.\nI also have to inform you that the crude oil allocated to this license has\nbeen fully paid for by the previous operator and whatever amount that is\npaid by the buyer each month will be shared between me and you at the\nsharing percentage of 40% for you and 60% for me. We will only be required\nto pay 3% royalty to the oil company and this will be paid when we have\nreceived the payment for the crude oil from the buyer into the account that\nyou will provide.\nI have already made arrangements with a prospective buyer who is willing to\npay upfront for the lifting of the crude allocated to this license for the\nmonth of May as long as the license is presented in your name. You can\ntherefore make arrangements for the buyers of subsequent allocations once\nthe first payment gets through. You will also provide the account where\nthis payment will be made once the license is reissued to your name. Once\nany payment is made and transferred to your bank account, I will come over\nto your country for the sharing of the payment according to the agreed\npercentage. You should therefore have nothing to fear as this is a genuine\nand risk free transaction.\nTo prove the genuineness of this project, I am hereby sending you a copy of\nmy company identity and a copy of the original operator's passport. Go\nthrough it and get back to me so that I will inform you of the information\nthat is required to get the company registration forms.  I will also get\nthe company registration forms and send them to you to fill and send back\nonce we have agreed.

Garki Abuja\nGreetings Dear Unpaid Beneficiary,\nThis is to inform you that in the course of my investigation as\ndirector of payment verification / implementation committee I came\nacross your name as unpaid fund beneficiary in the record of the\ncentral bank of Nigeria and other banks that are supposed to get your\nfunds released to you. My committee was set up by the payment\nreconciliation committee to verify and scrutinize all outstanding\ndebts owed to our foreign beneficiaries in accordance to the\ninformation received from the United States government and other\ncountries over unpaid huge debts owed to Foreigners.\nHaving seen your file and my further questioning to the officials of\nthe central Nigeria bank and ministry of finance as to why your\npayment is still pending reveals the rot and corruption in the system.\nThe bank officials told me that the reason why you haven't received\nyour payment is due to your inability to pay for the required charges\nfor transfer of funds to your account. When I asked them why they\ndidn't deduct the said charges from your principal sum, I was given\nthe flimsy excuse that you never authorized them to do so. When I put\nthe question across to them if they ever advised you that such charges\ncould be deducted from your principal fund,the answer I got was no.\nNow, if you do not tell this beneficiary that such charges could be\ndeducted from his or her principal fund, how will he or she know that\nsuch options are available for such beneficiaries.\nFrom my investigation I discovered that these bank officials\ndeliberately refused to let the charges be deducted from your\nprincipal fund because they want your fund to remain trapped in the\nbank, while they continue to extort money from beneficiaries under\nsome flimsy excuse. You do not need to pay any money to any official,\nall you are required to do is swear an affidavit at the federal high\ncourt of Nigeria, authorizing the bank to deduct all charges from your\nprincipal fund and transfer the balance of funds after deduction to\nyour bank account. If you have spent any money in the past in your\nquest for payment, kindly let me know so that I can follow this up.\nYou get back to me immediately in my email for a directive on how you\ncan get the deduction done as soon as possible and get your payment\nalso.\nYours sincerely,\nOlukayode Ariwoola GCON\nNew Chief Justice of Nigeria\nEmail:-olukayodeariwoolagcon110@mail.com   \n",

My father passed away when I was 21 while my mother passed away in 2009, I have uncles but we are not in a good relationship, I don't know the reason but it all started from my father and I couldn't question him at that moment.\nPresently I am 77 years old and I work with American Airlines. It was so shocking and sad that I contacted this deadly virus (COVID-19) which has taken so many lives out of this world.\nI am presently in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment. I have since lost my ability to talk and the doctor has told me that I have only a few weeks to live on this earth. so, I think the best thing to do is to use someone who is trustworthy that will inherit my funds, the reason why I decided to give out my funds is to avoid being taken by the government. I want you to utilize 60% of my fund's orphanages and widows around the world.\nPlease as soon as you receive this email reply back to me, I will give the details of my bank and also issue you a permission letter that will prove you as the new recipient of my funds.\nPlease assure me that you will use it as I mentioned and keep these contacts confidential.\nRegards\nMr. BRAIN L.Flynn\n",

With reference to your\nprevious e-mail received i must bring it to you that this transaction must\nbe done under legal/legitimate arrangement which is a very important aspect\nof this transaction and i must not do anything illegal. This is to avoid\nany breach of law and order of both countries. I would not want us to enter\na problem either in my country or in your country so i want us to do this\ntransaction legally.\nThis transaction must be kept as a top secret and very confidential from\nany third party or a person to avoid double claim or eyebrow. My office and\nthe accredited attorney must not know my involvement in this transaction to\navoid cancellation of this transfer process.\nHonestly before I contacted you, I prayed for God to direct me to you\nbecause there are great opportunities in your country that we can invest\ntogether.\nPlease do not lose this great opportunity because nothing\ngood comes easily.I vow to you that i have been monitoring this\naccount for a long time now and no one has ever come for the claim,\nPlease do not allow these greedy government politicians to confiscate\nthis fund into their personal pocket while there are millions of people out there\nsuffering due to lack of a job. My first priority is to make sure that the\nless privileged ones are employed in your country once we invest together\nwith this fund as soon as the funds hit your account in your country. I\nwould want us to  have a factory that can produce and accommodate people as\nstaff of the company in your country.\nI have attached an account screenshot and original copy of the deposit\ncertificate made by our late customer as a proof of the authenticity of this\ntransaction and for your perusal.\nUpon your return of this mail positively i shall guide you with Fund\nTransfer Application Form where you will fill out your information for\nproceeding of Approval from Bank of England  (BOE) and Final Fund Release\nOrder (FFRO)  Document in your favor.\nGod bless you and my regards to your entire family.\nRegards\nDr. Mark Grant\n",

The total amount in your ATM CARD is $10.5 million usd and this includes the interest rate up till date. The ATM CARD was programmed to have access globally where you can make withdrawals or transactions in any part of the world.\nIt seems you don't want to show any seriousness towards the shipment of your package. That's why he wants to return it but he needs permission from me first before he will return the package. I ordered him to stop and I also assured him that I will make sure I talk to you over this before he can then return the package if you show no seriousness. In regard to your ATM CARD package which is worth $10.5 million USD I will help you and make sure you receive it, and my investigation shows you have spent a lot of money recently in regard to this package.\nSo, my friend, I will be putting up the delivery agent email address for you to contact him immediately and stay in touch with him to deliver the package to you, the delivery agent's name is David Deemer and he's currently in the United States with your package. Sorry we didn't abandon you rather the delivery agent in charge of the delivery of your ATM CARD had an accident late last year so it automatically put a hold on all delivery he had to make, but he's better now and you can email him immediately with his email address; \ndaviddeemer323@gmail.com\n, to remind him of your ATM CARD in his possession but please remember you will have to do just 2 things when you email him, identify yourself with your full names, telephone number, home address and a photo of you or your ID for proper identification and then you will have to pay his flight ticket down to your place unless you're lucky to be in same state with him, that's all you will take care of and nothing more, nothing less, contact him now.\nHave a wonderful day!\nBest regards,\nMrs. Patt Joyce butler   \n",

        "inbound": "  Hello,\nI felt compelled to get in touch with you and discuss how we might help one another.\nMy name is Scott Thomson I assumed the role of President of Scotiabank on December 1, 2022 and became President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank on February 1, 2023. I have been a member of the Scotiabank Board of Directors since 2016.\nI firmly feel that God has placed you in my path at this precise moment. You will find this crucial business conversation interesting since you will gain from it, so I want to share it with you.\nThe estate of a respected client and friend who passed away recently is being administered by me, and it is estimated to be worth $77,000,000.00 (seventy seven million USD).\nAlthough he selected me as executor, knowing full well that I would have the authority to make any choices in the event of a sudden death, there was apparently no mention of an heir or next of kin in any of the estate project agreements with the bank from the outset.\nKnowing him for years, the fact that he never married, never had children, never introduced any form of family to me or the bank until his passing left me in a precarious and perplexed situation. The bank management asked the executor to provide instructions last week regarding what to do with the decedent's abandoned estate. As his executor, I am not permitted by law to inherit from, divert from, or claim this estate or any of its assets, but I am permitted to make decisions on whoever I deem to be a reasonably competent and capable claimant.\nI contacted you and am now requesting your cooperation to present you for the claim as a trustee because I have been looking for the ideal business-minded individual to share this ideas with and possibly present the individual for the claim. If I am unable to find a deserving individual for the claim, my bank's board of directors will not hesitate to divert the funds to their own selfish uses. Since the transaction will be carried out in accordance with a valid agreement that will safeguard you from any risks, there is no risk involved. Since the bank directors are already wealthy, it is preferable for us to take possession of the funds than to let them do so. I don't have a greedy nature, so I propose splitting the money 50/50 between the two parties. My share will help me to make a difference in the lives of many people who are dying, and I know the asset's owner would be happy if it wasn't mishandled or used for my own gain.\nAs soon as you let me know what you think about this, I'll reply with more information about the next steps in my response. Please keep this a secret between the two of us only until everything is formally arranged.\nPlease reply through my private email\nScottThomsonscotiabank@gmail.com\nGod bless you, and have a goo   \n",

Please do\nyour own research on the probate process to verify my understanding. I also\nwant to be clear that in order to make progress on the claim, this process\nwill require our wholehearted support, time, and some financial investment.\nThe insurance that prevents you from losing any money on this enterprise\nwill be handled by my bank. Therefore, I provide you a 100 percent\nmoney-back guarantee; if the high court rejects the probate, every penny\nspent on the procedure will be returned in full. For this reason, I\nindicated at the outset that the process was risk-free.\nSo, if you're completely on board, we'll move forward as soon as it's\nconvenient for you to do so by hiring a probate lawyer, whom I can heartily\nsuggest.\nIf you're serious about doing business, kindly let me know so that we may\ndiscuss how we might support one another. When you receive my email, please\nremember to reply to it as I will need your full name, address, phone\nnumber, and a copy of your passport.\nIf you follow my instructions as the executor, I promise this will be a\nsmooth experience that will change your life.\nHere is some more details about me:\nhttps://www.scotiabank.com/ca/en/about/our-company/executive-management/scott-thomson.html\nAcknowledge for follow up\nThanks\n",

        "inbound": "--\nHello,\nI felt compelled to get in touch with you and discuss how we might help one\nanother.\nMy name is Scott Thomson I assumed the role of President of Scotiabank on\nDecember 1, 2022 and became President and Chief Executive Officer of the\nBank on February 1, 2023. I have been a member of the Scotiabank Board of\nDirectors since 2016.\nI firmly feel that God has placed you in my path at this precise moment.\nYou will find this crucial business conversation interesting since you will\ngain from it, so I want to share it with you.\nThe estate of a respected client and friend who passed away recently is\nbeing administered by me, and it is estimated to be worth $77,000,000.00\n(seventy seven million USD).\nAlthough he selected me as executor, knowing full well that I would have\nthe authority to make any choices in the event of a sudden death, there was\napparently no mention of an heir or next of kin in any of the estate\nproject agreements with the bank from the outset.\nKnowing him for years, the fact that he never married, never had children,\nnever introduced any form of family to me or the bank until his passing\nleft me in a precarious and perplexed situation. The bank management asked\nthe executor to provide instructions last week regarding what to do with\nthe decedent's abandoned estate. As his executor, I am not permitted by law\nto inherit from, divert from, or claim this estate or any of its assets,\nbut I am permitted to make decisions on whoever I deem to be a reasonably\ncompetent and capable claimant.\nI contacted you and am now requesting your cooperation to present you for\nthe claim as a trustee because I have been looking for the ideal\nbusiness-minded individual to share this ideas with and possibly present\nthe individual for the claim. If I am unable to find a deserving individual\nfor the claim, my bank's board of directors will not hesitate to divert the\nfunds to their own selfish uses. Since the transaction will be carried out\nin accordance with a valid agreement that will safeguard you from any\nrisks, there is no risk involved. Since the bank directors are already\nwealthy, it is preferable for us to take possession of the funds than to\nlet them do so. I don't have a greedy nature, so I propose splitting the\nmoney 50/50 between the two parties. My share will help me to make a\ndifference in the lives of many people who are dying, and I know the\nasset's owner would be happy if it wasn't mishandled or used for my own\ngain.\nAs soon as you let me know what you think about this, I'll reply with more\ninformation about the next steps in my response. Please keep this a secret\nbetween the two of us only until everything is formally arranged.\nPlease reply\nGod bless you, and have a good day.\n",

I do not know if you have asked yourself why each time the approval of this fund is released, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped, and one problem or the other  will come up. If you have not asked yourself this question, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.\nSome time ago, your partners, I mean the people that introduced you to the business, they approached me through my wife who works with the HM Treasury, a Government's Economic and Finance Ministry and requested me to assist them conclude a money transfer deal they had with you. They asked me to assist them by removing the original contractor's details from the database and replacing it with your details to make you appear as the rightful beneficiary of this fund.\nI agreed to do it on condition that they will pay me GBP\u00a380,000.00 as soon as your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as we agreed and demanded to be paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me that you are the one that promised to send money to me, and up till now, I have not received a single cent from them and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude, I decided to  stop the fund release process because I cannot be denied my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my job..  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute any contract or inherit any claim, although I am the only person privileged to know this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude this money transfer deal.\nNow I am ready to forget the past, I do not need the GBP\u00a380.000.00 any longer from you but a good compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them are aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money unnecessarily to any of those Officers both here and overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did the work at the beginning and only I can diligently complete the pending funds.\nFinally, I need your promise that no official of those Banks you have contacted before will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my compensation will be lodged.\nI am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with me, kindly contact me so that we can have a chat over this issue once and for all. But if the reverse is the case, do not bother yourself to reach me and forget about this money.\nBEST REGARDS\nRichard Meddings,\nFinancial Unit Programme Officer    \n",

My Name is Mr. John nkosi   I earn a living in the oil industry as an independent Feasibility/Project Management Consultant to oil refineries and other oil industries in Southern African, East Africa and some parts of Asia. We are based in\nJohannesburg RSA. Our mandate includes identifying specific licensed crude oil export/ marketing firms and recommending these firms to the oil refineries for supply of crude oil to the refineries.\nOn my desk is a mandate from one the refineries to arrange for crude oil purchase from Libya for up to 2,000,000 barrels on monthly bases for 12 calendar months.\nThe essence of my reaching out to you is the fact that I am in the process of building a middle man structure to mediate between the 2 parties involved before the contract is signed. You may be wondering why I cannot do it by myself right? The honest fact is that as a consultant\nto these oil refineries, we are not allowed to act as suppliers of crude oil to them as well, hence the reason I need a trustworthy person outside my work circle in order to maintain a discreet profile.\nI wish to extend this partnership to you my friend to build a middle man structure with you, while I work from the back to guide you. Our commission/brokerage as middle persons is between $2 - $3 per barrel as case may be. So if the target of 2M barrels is met monthly we stand to share $4M - $6M every month for a span of 12 months with possible\nextension.\nWorry less about the speedy sales as I have contacts within oil producing country's top officials for license of crude oil export/lifting to any firm I so present for this business. Therefore if you can be able to handle this transaction with honesty and integrity, you should come back to me immediately for more details. Your urgent response is highly needed and you can reach me on the following email address: \nMrjohnnkosi000@gmail.com\nRegards\n",

Your reply I believe is an\nindication that you are willing to be part of this business opportunity,\nAlso this will not prevent you from doing your normal business as this\nproject is on the side for making extra income as a legal crude oil license\nholder. As long as you are going to be sincere towards this project, we\nwill have reasons to celebrate in the end. The business is completely legal\nand you have nothing to worry about.*\n*PLEASE READ THE DETAILS AND GET BACK TO ME*\n*You are to become a middleman/sales agent between the buyer and the\nNational Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC). You will be corresponding between\nthe NOC (seller) and (buyer) electronically from the comfort of your home.\nTo set the ball rolling in this venture, the first step is for us to apply\nfor the crude oil export and marketing license from the NOC.*\n*There are two ways through which you can apply for the license, one you\ncan apply in your company name if you have a registered company or you can\napply as an individual in your name. I will draft a license application\nletter for you to fill and send to the Licensing operations department of\nthe NOC to apply for the license. You will type the license application\nletter into your official company letterhead paper.*\n*(If you want to apply in your company name) and send the application\ndirectly to the licensing operations department of the NOC which is\nresponsible for issuing crude oil sales licenses. I will direct you step by\nstep from the process of acquiring the license to become the middleman to\nthe process of selling your allocated product to the BUYER.*\n*The role of a middleman is to locate buyers for the crude oil that will be\nallocated to you being a license owner with the NOC and act on behalf of\nthe NOC in selling the crude to the buyer. This is simply because the NOC\ndoes not deal directly with the buyers of their product but through\napproved licensed agents who serve as their sales agents/middleman in their\nsales operations.*\n*I will link you up with one company which has intentions to buy 2 million\nbarrels of Libyan crude on monthly bases for 1 year. (So the commissions\nare paid out every month throughout the duration of the 12month\ncontract.)This implies that you will not have problems finding buyers. I\nwill guide you to apply for the license and also guide you step by step in\nall your correspondences between the NOC and the BUYER until the BUYER pays\nthe NOC for the crude after which your commissions will be calculated and\npaid into your nominated receiving bank account.*\n*Getting this license will give you the legal authorization of the NOC to\nbecome their sales agent. Please be informed that getting this license is\nnever a walk in the park because of the prospective nature of the\ncommissions paid to license owners every month. The licenses are usually\ngiven to the families and relatives of the top government officials as they\ndid not want people to benefit from such a lucrative venture. But I have\nsomeone in the ministry of oil and gas who will assist us in getting the\nlicense.*\n*I will guide you to apply for this license and once you obtain it, the new\ndoors will open. So I will need you to confirm if you want to apply for the\nlicense in your company name or in your individual name but company name is\npreferable.*\n*Awaiting your reply to enable us to move towards applying for the license.*\n*Regards*\n*Mr  John nkosi *\n",

THUS, No\nPAYMENT OFFICER THAT WILL DEMAND ANY SINGLE PENNY FROM YOU.\nIn view of this , kindly SEND ME YOUR INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT AND YOUR\nDIRECT TELEPHONE URGENTLY if you are  REALLY interested to receive\nyour fund by traveling to the PAYMENT CENTER for the signing of the\nFINAL FUND RELEASE AUTHORITY DOCUMENTS.\nThe earlier you do this the better for the release of your fund,\nbecause in the course of this Traveling  you will not be part of the\nexpenses such as your TRAVELING TICKET, ACCOMMODATION/RESERVATION AND\nYOUR FEEDING WITHIN 3-4 DAYS WILL BE PAID BY THE CHIEF SPONSOR so you\nare expected to contribute nothing until you are paid.\nThat is, you have nothing , i said nothing to contribute until you\nreceive your payment.\nMy Direct Phone number is + 44 74 52 33 88 36 for further discussion.\nAlso  WHAT APP NUMBER :+44 74 52 33 88 36.\nThis is Just The Little Human contribution to your financial plight.\nThis arrangement is strictly (only) for beneficiaries who are willing\nto travel and finalize their payment by the investors.\nInvestors are not available for  beneficiaries unable to Travel.
