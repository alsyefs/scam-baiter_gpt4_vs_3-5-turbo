Attention:
We sincerely apologize for sending you this sensitive information via e-mail instead of a certified mail, post-mail, phone or face to face conversation. It's due to the urgency and importance of the security information of your citizenry. I am Special Agent John Edward from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Field Intelligence Unit (FIU).
We intercepted two consignment boxes at JFK Airport, New York. The boxes were scanned and they contained a large sum of money ($4.1million) and also some backup documents which bear your name as the Beneficiary/Receiver of the money. Investigation was carried out on the diplomat that accompanied the boxes into the United States and he said that he was to deliver the fund to your residence as overdue payment owed to you by the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the security company in the United Kingdom.
After cross-checking all legal documents in the boxes, we found out that your consignment was lacking two important documents and we can't release the boxes to the diplomat until the document is brought forth, we have no other option than to confiscate your consignment.
According to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in Title 26 also contain reporting requirement on a Form 8300, Report of Cash Payment Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business, money laundering activity may violate 18 USC §1956, 18 USC 1957, 18 USC 1960, and provision of Title 31, and 26 USC 6050I of the United States Code (USC), this section will discuss only those money laundering and currency violation under the jurisdiction of IRS, 
your consignment lacks proof of ownership

 to enable us relieved the charge of evading the law on you, which is a punishable offence in the United States.
You are required to reply back within 72 hours or you will be prosecuted in a court of law for money laundering
, also you are instructed to desist from further contact with any bank(s) or person(s) in Nigeria or the United Kingdom or any part of the world regarding your payment because your consignment has been confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation here in the United States.

Attention: Sir,
Your comprehensive email was received and you must know that your consignment has already been taken to our storage vault pending until when you get the required certificate for your consignment release. There is no doubt that you are the rightful beneficiary of this sum of money contained in the consignment, but maybe you are not aware of it due to the plot by some involved officials to divert this money to satisfy their own greed.
Be informed that failure to follow instructions and get your funds cleared will only mean that you are committing a federal offence of tax evasion which is punishable under the law.
The consignment in question is part of your winning prize/beneficiary inheritance payment as it was stated on the delivery invoice recovered from the diplomat who wanted to abscond with your funds before he was apprehended by my men, your consignment has to pass through the legal clearance process before the green light can be granted for the release to you as mandated by the White House.
To get this resolved and your consignment legally released for delivery to your residence, you are requested to provide the FUND OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATE and CERTIFICATE OF LEGALITY for the money contained in the boxes which you are to obtain with the assistance of the official who will be working with you to make sure that you get the required certificate.
Her Contact Information is:

I advise you to send an email immediately and ask her how you can get the certificate and how much it will cost you, so that you can comply immediately, also make sure you work only with the above official (Ann Clark) on your consignment release matter.

Greg Famer a national of your country who was a Contractor and Chief Executive officer of {Asian development Oil Company} For 25 years. He has spent most of his life in (Madrid Spain). In January 2020, Engr. Greg fell sick and died due to the Corona-virus pandemic.
Since then I have made several inquiries in the Embassy to locate any of my client's extended relatives but all efforts were unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you and solicit your assistance as a foreigner because you bear the same last name .To execute the claim of his Estate Which includes cash deposits.
I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the assets and Capital valued at US$9.8 million Dollars (Nine Million Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) left behind by my client before they get
confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. The said bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next month.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives.  I seek the consent to present you as the Next of kin to the deceased. The request of a foreigner as the next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that my client was a foreigner and the money cannot be paid into a local bank here, so it will be better for you to stand as the next of kin to my client. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer. I have all necessary information
and legal documents needed to back you up for claim.
All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us to see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. 
Best Regards,
Barr. Thomas Miguel  Luis

I suggest that you continue your search for his extended relatives or heirs. I wish you all the best in your endeavors.

Thank you once again for your message and also for accepting to handle
the investment for me.
Now my good friend, like I said in my second message to you, for
handling the investment project for me, I will give you the 15% of the
total sum, of $150M (One Hundred and Fifty Million United States)
which is going to be the first part of the fund to be disposed for the
investment. so while reply let me know if this is ok by you.
More so, can you prepare a feasibility study on the stated amount with
any area of the stated investment Real Estate, Oil and Gas, and
Tourism (5star Hotels) , so that I will go through for us to commence
action immediately to the investment.
Meanwhile, based on my ill health and condition here in Brussels, I
can not be able to handle the affairs of the said investment, so I
will like us to have a lawyer who will be working with you to get all
the necessary documentations to backup the transfer of the investment
amount to your bank account. And when do you think you can be able to
fly down to UK for the face to face meeting with my In-law, so that I
will let my in-law know, so that he can arrange for the meeting.
Also if this is ok by you, I will instruct the lawyer to go ahead and
prepare an MOU which you shall go through and make any amendment, then
sign and send bank to me to sign, so you have to start now to look for
the area where you shall have the investment.
Finally, also based on my ill health, I can not be able to lay hands
to physical money to fund the documentations, so at this point I would
like to let you know that you will be expected to spend some money to
secure the documentations, which I will reimburse you as soon as the
investment funds hits your bank account, so all you will have to do is
to keep accurate record of all you shall spend so that at the end of
it all, you present your invoice for reimbursement,and this will be
included in the MOU, so get back to me urgently so that we can
commence. I will also wish to have the following from you:
Your full names
Your address.
Copy of your id card or International passport(for proper identification)
Your telephone number
Company name and address (if any)

As I mentioned in my previous message, there are shipments of cash that can
be delivered to you in bits, depending on your capacity to receive them. My
contact in The United Nations and The European Union can deliver them
safely, provided that you meet the delivery requirements.
Please note that my partners have taken care of the bills and charges for
the release of the shipments, so you do not need to worry about them.
However, the agent from the delivery company will not know the true content
of the shipments and it is essential that you do not disclose it to them.
It is your responsibility as the beneficiary to ensure that the customs
duty, VAT, and handling charges are sorted out in your country to avoid the
shipment being processed by your airport
authorities. These are the guidelines given to us by the company and it is
crucial that you follow them. If you cannot handle your part of the project
in your country,nothing can be done on my part as my partners will not
grant approval for the release of the shipments for dispatch when the part
of the beneficiary/receiver is not guaranteed, unless the delivery company
confirms that the beneficiary/receiver can meet their delivery requirement
when they arrive in their country.
Please note that this project requires utmost trust and dedication from
you. After the safe delivery of the shipment, a representative from my
partners will meet with you in your country for further discussion on
disbursement and investment purposes.

responding to you. I visited my friend in Saudi Arabia..
This entire project consists of re-organizing the ownership status of $19M
inherited by my client from her late husband who held a sensitive position
in the government of his country, and subsequently transferring it to you
for immediate investment on Commercial and Residential Real Estate in your
country, or any country you feel is good for such. The Real Estate
investment area will be acquiring Commercial properties and Residential
Houses, or any other lucrative business/investment you are familiar with,
that is guaranteed to make some profits
My client will remain silent and anonymous throughout the period of
movement of the funds from the Bank to the new Beneficiary/Recipient
Account and will not get involved either directly or indirectly. All
correspondence associated with this transaction will be strictly addressed
to me.
After this money has been transferred to your country, it is my client's
wish to set up a company there in your Country if you don't have any and
the company will be used for the property acquisition and all other
transactions relating to this investment. We do not know much about your
Country so it will be your decision on which cities to invest in; this is
why we need your services.
Consequently, this transaction may commence without delay, if everything
requested from your side is ready. All that is needed is your trust and
commitment in this, and you will temporarily receive the funds to your
company or to you in person if you do not have a company..
Please, be informed that before we can proceed deep into this transaction,
we will have to enter into a contract agreement which will clearly state
our interests and stakes in this transaction so that we will not have any
misunderstanding or misrepresentation whatsoever during this investment
project.
Please, provide me your details as below; so we can get the ball rolling.
Full names:
Company Name:
Contact Address:
Whatsapp/mobile number
Occupation:
Position Held:
Age:
Sex:
A copy of your international passport or any government issued ID should be
attached:
As soon as I get the above, a contract agreement and all necessary
documents will be sent to you, and I'll provide you with proof of
funds.These documents will mandate you to claim the fund as the new
beneficiary for immediate commencement of the investments. Let me use this
opportunity to inform you that all transactions will be conducted inside
the full circles of local and international laws and nothing illegal will
be done whatsoever during the course of conducting this transaction and I
also ask for your full trust and honesty as well as undivided attention in
this relationship.
I do appeal for your understanding and I also want to assure you that we
don't wish to delay nor to waste your time. After the funds have been
transferred to you, me and my client will be coming over to meet you in
your Country for your little percent partnership payment and also to sit
down and discuss more on the investments. Once again, I thank you for your
willingness in this, as I look forward to a successful establishment.
Best regards,
Abdel.

124,dx51706.json,Classifier,2023-04-25 16:14:40,"   Dearest one in the Lord
It is my pleasure to write to you after considering your profile. My
name is Mrs. Elizabeth J. GLIBERT is a nationality of the United
States of America. I am married to MR.GLIBERT ANTHONY who worked with
Kuwait Petroleum Corporation in the United Kingdom for nine years
before he died in the year 2014. We were married for eleven years
without a child; he died after a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.
When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of $18.5 million
(Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) with a BANK in
Europe Presently, this money is still with the BANK. Recently, my
Doctor told me that I would not last for the next one or two months
due to a long term cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my
stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to
church or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this
money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to use this
fund for churches, orphanages, Research centers and widows propagating
to the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.
The Bible made us understand that blessed is the hand that gives. I
took this bold decision because I don’t have any child that will
inherit this money and my husband’s relatives are not Christians and I
don’t want my family's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers.
I don’t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly
manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.
I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I
am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the
lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things
are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall detail you more
and I will give the contact of the BANK as soon as I am sure that you
will do the will of God. I will also issue you a letter of authority
that will empower you as the new beneficiary of this Fund. I want you
to always pray for me because the lord is my Shepherd. My happiness is
that I lived the life of a worthy Christian.
Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in
your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Christian
individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act
accordingly as I stated here.
Hoping to hear from you soon!
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours-in-Christ,
Mrs. Elizabeth J ANTHONY.

Thank you very much for your quick response. Well, I really understood
your email, But i want you to consider me in regards to this
transaction as I don't know how long I will last again.  I was very
happy when I received your mail. I have made up my mind to give out my
fund for the work of God as a ransom seed for my soul. If that is the
only thing I will do to receive my healing, I have to do it. If that
is the only thing I will do to make heaven when I die, please don’t  I
have to do it. My prayer is that when the fund gets to you, let God
give you the wisdom to utilize it for things that will glorify his
holy name.
Please, help me in prayers, I don't want to die, I want to live and
declare the glory of God upon my life. I know that I will definitely
come out of this sickness because I have faith. My faith is based on
Job's experience, people thought that Job would die, he lost
everything he had but he believed in God and finally he was restored.
I am giving everything out for the name of my God to be glorified. I

Greetings my beloved,
  I sent this mail praying it will get to you in a good condition of health, My name is Mrs,Alice,Robinson. I am a Citizen of United states of America (U.S.A) I am married to, late Mr.George.Adams.Robinson,Who was a small gold company owner. My late husband died on an airline crash, in the year February 2010, During his lifetime he deposited the sum of ($11,000,000.00 Dollars).In the bank  The money was from the sale of his company and death benefits payment and entitlements of my late husband by his company. I am sending you this message with heavy tears in my eyes and great sorrow in my heart, and also praying that it will reach you in good health because I am not in good health, I sleep every night without knowing if I may be alive to see the next day. I am suffering from long time cancer and presently I am partially suffering from Leprosy, which has become difficult for me to move around. I was married to my late husband for more than 6 years without having a child. And my doctor just confirmed to me that I have less chance to live, having to know when the cup of death will come, I decided to contact you to claim the fund since I don't have any relation.I grew up from an orphanage home, I have decided to donate this money for the support of helping Motherless babies, Less privileged/Widows and churches also to build the house of God because I am dying and diagnosed with cancer for about 3 years ago. I have decided to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband to you, for the good work of Almighty God. I will be going in for an operation surgery soon,Now I want you to stand as my next of kin to claim the funds for charity purposes. Because if this money remains unclaimed after my death, the bank executives or the government will take the money as unclaimed fund and maybe use it for selfishness and worthless ventures, I need a very honest person who can claim this money and use it for Charity works, for orphanages, widows and also build schools and churches for less privilege that will be named after my late husband and my name. Please I'm waiting for your prompt response if only you are interested. I will send you further details and the bank contact details where the fund has been deposited for you to contact the Bank for immediate release and transfer of the fund into your bank account as my rightful beneficiary.
Respectfully,Mrs,Alice,Robinson,

fund to you for the orphanage project and I pray that you will not be moved
to reject my appeal for any reason.I want you to understand that you are
not helping me; rather you are working for God according to his word in
Isaiah 1:16-18; James 1:27, I Timothy 6:17-19. I know the fact that I will
not survive this illness, and cannot do anything from this sick bed but my
quest to use the fund in such a way which shall please God and God has
prompted me to contact you in this manner.The Fund was deposited here in
Burkina Faso by my late husband before his sudden death with my name as the
legal appointed next of kin's, and I have the information and document to
be able to make the claim so I will provide it to the bank with a letter
authorizing them to release the fund to you as the final beneficiary. This
will enable the bank to approve and release the fund to you immediately and
without any problem, so please do not see this as the opportunity to enrich
yourself knowing that I have no way of monitoring you from this sick bed.
You should always consider my faith and trust in you and do as we agreed
upon. I want you to take 40% of the total fund for you while 60% are for
the project to take care of the orphanages and the less privileged in your
country or any part of the world. I will leave everything to you believing
that God has finally granted my wish of building a home for his children,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter. Within the Eskom Holdings Limited where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation, I have in my possession an overdue payment in US funds.   
The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which, I the official over-invoiced to the amount of US$45,000, 000.00 (Forty Five Million United States Dollar). Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor leaving the excess balance unclaimed. Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relationship with foreign governments and non-government agencies, I included the, bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB).   
I am seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since I am not allowed to operate foreign accounts, Details and change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of you/your Company. I have to propose that should you be willing to assist me in this transaction your share as compensation will be (35%), and the balance of (65%) will be for me. The business is completely safe and secure, provided you treat it with Utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you/your Company does contract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favor of you/your Company. Also, your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.   
I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.

    We received a letter of attestation from an attorney representing you in respect to your overdue fund demanding for issuance of letter of Authorization(LOA) from our office to cover the relevant security clearance as demanded by Bank of Settlement where your fund is invested, with the aim of awarding the change of ownership to another person stating that you died in a vehicle accident that occurred in your country where only pictures inscribed with the date of the accident was taken at the scene of the accident was provided as evidence.
    On the contrary, the signal, and report gathered from our real-time and a pain-staking investigation carried out with the help of our high-tech infrastructure of both technical and operational support systems aiding us in meeting the growing challenges of fighting crime in this 21st century. It was discovered that your name, identity, and email were currently used to transfer and invest the total sum of $51,000,000.00 in the Settlement Bank of United States and the dividend currently running up to $ 15,000,000.00. We have all the document here to confirm this claim
    Now the questions are, how can a dead man be actively involved in fund investment without the presence of the next of kin who is supposed to be the signatory?  Secondly, could this lawyer be trying to play a smart one? and lastly but not the least, This office has not at any time been notified either by email or letter by any medical practitioner certifying your deceased state or any document issued by any member of your family or from a registrar of vital statistics that declares the date, location, and cause of your death.
We have tried severally to reach-out to you by sending emails to your address and several attempted calls made, but all have so far proved abortive, hence this office is left with no other option than to send this reminder message to your email ones again, as we would not accept to be held liable for any loss of your rights and fund to a wrong person. If you are still alive, do respond with your form of identification for final confirmation without delays, as we have already informed the bank that the real beneficiary of the fund may likely still be alive without even realizing what the lawyer whom so much was entrusted to have been up to.

Thank you for reaching out to me regarding my overdue fund. I am surprised to hear about the attorney's claim that I died in a vehicle accident and that my name, identity, and email are being used to transfer and invest funds. I can assure you that I am very much alive and have not authorized anyone to use my information for such purposes.
I appreciate your efforts to contact me and would like to know more about the documents you have that confirm the claim made by the attorney. Can you please provide me with more details about the fund and the bank where it is invested? Also, I would like to know what steps I need to take to ensure that my rights and funds are protected.
Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Thanks for your response to my earlier email. I hope with this explanation
you will understand better my purpose of contacting you please read
carefully and patiently.
In June 2015, one of our foreign customers made a Fixed deposit for 36
calendar months, valued at US$35,500,000.00 in our bank where l am head of
accounts department.
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but
got no reply. After waiting several months, we sent a reminder and finally
discovered from his contract employers that he and his family died in a
plane crash.
On further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a WILL
and all attempts to trace extended members of his family were never
successful. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he
did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents
in his Bank Deposit paperwork at my Bank.
His money (US$35,000,000.00 ) has been floating as unclaimed since maturity
and all efforts to get his relatives have proved unsuccessful. According to
our banking policy, if such money continues to remain unclaimed, the money
will be passed to the coffers of the Central bank treasury unclaimed bill.
It's been many years now and nobody has shown up for the money. My proposal
to you is that l want you to cooperate with me to enable us to claim the
money so we can both use it for investment . I will put all the necessary
documents together to make you the next of kin so that the money will be
paid to you. I have secured from the probate court an order of mandamus to
locate any family member of the deceased so that the money can be paid to
him or her, but still no success.
If you agree to cooperate with me, after successful execution of this deal,
we shall share the money in percentage of 50/50. I assure you that this
deal is 100% risk free, you don't have to fear anything as l am a
professional in Real Estate Banking / Family Wealth
If you are interested in engaging in this deal, please respond in earliest
upon reception of this message so I can confidently explain to you more
Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
JJ Kwame.

Thank you for reaching out to me and explaining the situation. I am sorry to hear about the loss of your customer and their family.

153,ev51254.json,Chat1,2023-04-21 10:17:16,"Dear Alberto,
Thanks for your response. First and foremost, let me reassure you that this
is a 100% legal transaction. People around the world claim on their late
relatives estate on a daily basis and this is just one of such claims -
only this time, you are not related with the deceased and working with a
bank insider (me) who was the deceased account officer. I will provide you
with all relevant documents and guide you through the claim process and we
share the funds at a 50/50 ratio after claim. I will guide you through the
probate application and the only thing that can fuck this deal is if at any
point during the claim process you open up to somebody and my bank gets to
know that you are not related to the deceased depositor.
That will not only ruin my career but might as well earn me some jail time
for misrepresentation/falsification of information to defraud the bank.
Other than that, if you agree to work with me and keep this transaction
confidential, we can claim these funds in less than 10 banking days if you
follow instructions and do as I tell you. So, for a start, you have to give
me your full details;
* Full name
* Age or Date of birth
* Occupation
* Address
* Telephone number
The process is simple, it starts with a false alarm to my colleagues that a
relative of the deceased contacted me and I have asked you to send an
email. I will give you a text draft that you will send to the appropriate
department, once you send the email, I will check and find your name in our
file, which I have already created with above details, which I will submit
for approval. Then you go through probate to get a letter of administration
(I will guide you on how to go about that) and submit it to the bank and
direct them to transfer the funds to your designated bank account. The
funds are currently in a suspense account with our bank.
I will guide you with more details when you reply to this mail.
Waiting for your feedback.

JJ Kwame

Thank you for your email and for explaining the process to me. I appreciate your reassurance that this is legal. However, I am a bit hesitant to provide my personal information at this time. Can you please provide me with more information about the deceased and the amount of funds involved? Also, can you explain to me why you are willing to share the funds with me? I just want to make sure that everything is legitimate before proceeding.

I am willing to share the funds with you because I need your financial
assistance in the legal fees. We need a letter of administration from the
court and a lawyer is required to file the affidavit of death to the
probate court to obtain the letter of administration in your name. This
will cost some money and that's the only area I will be needing your
assistance.
If you are ready and willing to proceed, please respond with commitment
that we are in this together. We shall share the burden and proceeds. We
can't proceed with half commitment because we cannot afford to commence and
get stuck in the middle, that's a recipe for trouble. Immediately the funds
are safely transferred into your account, I can open a Domiciliary Account
in Panama where my share can be transferred under with internet access. I
will guide you through this process, provided you agree to work with me and
keep it confidential.

I’m Zhanna Monastyrskyy, wife of late interior minister Denys Monastyrskyy who died in a helicopter plane crash .
I need your attention and assistance in the distribution of my late husband’s wealth . My gallant husband who served the Ukraine government was involved in a ghastly helicopter accident which led to his death in January 2023 . Before his death , I have been bedridden with cancer, a condition which I have been managing and treating for a long time but has gotten to an unmanageable stage with a proposed life expectancy of not more than two
months handed over to me .. However my husband , given his financial exposure with the government, willed his funds and a house in the USA to me . I have no intention of selling the house but rather my intention is to donate the funds to a reputable charity organization in the states which can be done by proxy since I’m currently not in the state .
If you’re willing to assist , kindly reply back for more details as I will reward you financially for assisting in the project or helping the poor and needy .
Thank you

220,fz99964.json,Chat1,2023-04-09 12:12:32,"   I sent this letter with a prayer so that it reached you with good health, since I myself i am in a very critical state of health, in which I sleep every night, not knowing if I can live until the next day. I'm Mrs Maria Bouchard. And an aging widow suffering from a long Cancer illness. I have some funds that I inherited from my deceased husband, the amount (15.6 million. Dollars). And I needed a very honest and sincere person, an individual or cooperating organization that would use this foundation for the work of humanity,
I want you to take 40% of the total amount of money for personal use. While 60% of the money goes to charity ""people on the street and to help the orphanage. I grew up as an orphan, and I have no one, like my family member, just to save the house of God. I do this in order so that God will forgive my sins and take my soul because these diseases have suffered me so much, My late husband made me realize that it is good to remember and shelter the poor  and the needy ones, He saw me that day when he came, to visit the Orphanage home at Canton Zurich Switzerland and asked for my hand in marriage, I have to follow his steps and help the needy,
I do not want a situation where this money will not be used in a Godly way. That is why I make this decision. I'm not afraid of death, so I know where I'm going. I know that I will be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that ""the lord will fight my case, and I will be silent."" I do not need any telephone communication in this regard due to the state of my health and the presence of relatives of my late husband around me, always trying to get this money from me, which my husband left for me. I do not want them to know about this development. With God's help all things are possible.
I found your email address in the personnel department database and decided to contact you. Please, if you can use the tools for the work of humanity, as I said here. To fulfill my late husband and my wish please
Try checking the spam box, because most of these matches sometimes fall in the SPAM folder.
Please reply to me immediately via this my personal email address for security reasons.
Thank you.

The amount of money involved is US$15.6 million, this money was the
proceeds from the sales of my late husbands properties and shares, we do
not have any child and I am not a Ghanaian, I met my husband when he came
for greener pastures in my home country Switzerland, all we worked for was
used to train my late husbands relatives and we were all happy, as soon as
my husband died, they all turned against me and wanted to kill me also to
take over everything we laboured for.
I managed to sell the ones I could lay my hands on and kept the money away
in a security company in Ghana with the help of our family lawyer before
departing to my home country since my late husbands relatives do not want
me alive, I took ill after one of the reconciliatory meetings called by
some elders and that is what I am still suffering from till date.
The lawyer in Ghana will direct you how to go about the release of the
money since my days are numbered, my main aim is to hand you over
everything before I join my great and wonderful husband.

I want to go neutral and I want to invest $58M in your Country through
a neutral individual like you and I will move this fund to you if you

Dear Sir,
Good morning here,
I am Dr.Larry Wayne Ellis, Head Director Deeds Trust Capital Bank
USA., I am writing you this letter because a cool penny is better than
millions of dollars. It is better for one to live and die a poor
honest man than a rich dishonest one. I and the chief information
security officer of this bank have arranged with an insider in the
computer strong room to bring out your part payment amounting five
million United States dollars.
We did this because according to information gathered from the bank's
computer room, you have been waiting for a long time to receive your
fund without success. We also found out that you have almost met all
the statutory requirements of the bank for the release of your fund,
your problem is that of interest groups.
A lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are
merely doing paper work with you and that explains why you
receives,emails and phone messages from different people. Also we
found out that officials of various ministries  have been extorting a
lot of money from you in the pretext of helping you and we advise you
now to stop and do away with those scammers.
I am willing to help you get your money but please for top security
reasons do not tell anybody until you confirm the payment with you.
Note: we have decided to contact you following the reports we received
from Anti-Fraud International Monitoring Group your name/email has
been submitted to us therefore the United Nations have agreed to pay
you with part payment amounting the sum of($5,000,000.00) this part
payment is also including international business that failed due to
Covid-19 problems etc. We have arranged your part payment through
online banking transfer OR through ATM MasterCard/ Visa Card which is
the latest instruction from the World Bank president Mr.David Malpass.
Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may cause a lot of problems if
found out that we are using this way to help you, do not ever tell
anybody about this until you have your cash with you. I want to help
you because I will soon retire from my government and I want to come
over to your country with my family so that you can assist me when I
relocate to your country with my family.
Thank you and please get back to us as soon as you receive this mail
to enable us to proceed.
Waiting for your immediate response.
Yours Faithfully,
Dr.Larry Wayne Ellis

Thank you for your email. However, I must say that I am quite skeptical about this offer. I have not been informed of any such payment from your bank and I have not been waiting for any payment for a long time. I also find it hard to believe that an insider in the computer strong room would be willing to risk their job and freedom to bring out my payment.
Furthermore, I have not been extorted by any officials of various ministries and I have not been receiving phone messages from different people. I believe this email is a scam and I will not be providing any personal information or sending any money.
I advise you to stop this fraudulent activity and focus on legitimate banking operations.

Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC)
Port Harcourt , Rivers State
www. nddc.gov.ng
Attention,
It is of pleasure contacting you via email. I came across your contact via the World Trade Center (W.T.C.)   African Regional office , without disclosure of my intentions which is personal.
As an authority here in Niger Delta Development Commission, I noticed  three executed contracts which have not been paid for and the contractors who executed these contracts could not be traced or reached  till this moment.Upon my resumption in the office, I called for internal auditing after hand over, I realized  so many  financial lapses involving   huge  contract sum  amounting to Forty Million , Six Hundred and Fourteen Thousand United States of America Dollars (US$40,614,000 Million), Twenty One Million United States of America Dollars (UDS$21 Million ) and Ten Million, Five Hundred  Thousand (US$10,500,000)  respectively.
I further investigated to find out that these  funds were products of over invoicing  from contractors / companies whom  actually and genuinely were awarded  contracts respectively and they  executed the jobs and were duly paid  with Job completion certificates issued ,but my predecessors  could not move the left over  funds  due to
unexpected call for their resignation/ removal from the office ( WRONG TIMING).  Since their resignation,Some of them have  secretly and personally approached me  to cover  these transactions  for them by not disclosing to anyone or leave it in the  NDDC accounts/ records  in order not to implicate them, rather , i should  protect their image and   secure these funds for me and my cabinets as these funds have been there and cannot be declared to the Government , if disclosed, some higher authorities  will find ways to  claim it. I have recently discussed  and agreed with the Executive Project Director, Chief Accountant and  Financial Director  to secure and move this fund outside the country .
However, we further noticed that the  companies used in securing these funds respectively were neither  incorporated  as a legal entity with the Corporate Affairs Commission nor registered with Niger Delta Development Commission as contractors, making it difficult to neither function in business nor authorize for contract payment.
I am fully aware of the activities of some unscrupulous people that are currently going on in our world today which you must have been fully acquainted with unpleasant stories, especially this part. But the truth also remains that the world has not been totally invaded by this group of people hence, people can still do businesses together all over the world and further establish healthier personal and business relationships.
Having explained this , I seek your consent to partner with  us and  secure this fund in your name or company's name. All documents shall be legally provided to suit the purpose . As the Chairman/CEO of Niger Delta Development Commission(NDDC), I cannot risk or gamble with my position. There is no risk whatsoever attached. We will award you with 15% of any secured funds with you and our shares shall  also be invested with you in your country pending when our tenure in the office will elapse .
Kindly get back to me  with your Full name and telephone / mobile number for more details 
if agreed to work with us.Also, I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangements that will protect you from any breach of the law.
Thank you.
Yours faithfully,
Dr Samuel Ogboku.

Thank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this matter with you. However, I must say that I am a bit skeptical about the proposal you have presented. Can you provide more information about the contracts that were executed and the companies involved? Also, I would like to know more about the legalities of moving the funds outside the country.

Thank you very much for your mail and interest towards actualizing
this business.
ok for oil and gas business,you can buy a land in a strategic
locations ,build a world class filling station  or Premium Motor
Spirit (PMS) in more than 10 locations.it is very very lucrative.
Secondly, you can add it up with Textiles and Real Estate
industries,as we proceed and see your seriousness and hard working,if
the funds is not enough there must be some thing the investor will
tell you.
Notwithstanding,the most important thing right now is to make sure the
funds is pulled out ABSA bank to your custody for safety as soon as
possible so that you can cool down to learn or study areas not to
familiar to you by which you wish to invest the funds.
Lastly,the ESCROW SUSPENSE AGREEMENT ACCOUNT:means a particular funds
deposited into bank for safety without BOLDLY mention the names and
particulars of  the depositor for security reasons,but a certificate
of agreement was reached between the depositor and the bank,which will
not attract any interest. Remember the investor Mr Rafael Savimbi Jr

from.

I am Mrs. Marry Derick. from Atlanta USA, my decision to contact you
is because I have been recently diagnosed with Lungs Cancer and the
doctor said I have less than 6 months to live, since this sudden news
was announced to me, I have been reflecting over my life in the past,
is painful that after over 26 years of peaceful marriage with my late
Husband Mr. Biden Derick , we lost the only child that would have
inherited our numerous wealth.In the past, I have made reasonable
donations to the victims of Earthquake in Haiti and recently to the
same victims in Japan and Thailand, now that my health is gradually
deteriorating, I cannot continue to do all these by myself any more, I
strongly desire to reach out to the poor and needy people, but I would
prefer to continue this with the assistance of a kind person.
I want you to answer the following questions:
1. Are you a God fearing person? 2. If I donate $15.5M (Fifteen
Million five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to you, will you
be able to utilize it wisely to achieve my heart desire of supporting
poor people around you? 3. Will you open a charity foundation in the
name of my late husband and me?
Would you be able to be help me set up a motherless baby’s home in my
memorial when I am gone, then keep 25% of the money for your effort.
Please reply me directly as soon as possible:
Hope to hear from you soon.
Yours sincerely,
Marry Derick

284,hl06437.json,Classifier,2023-04-13 17:26:41,"My Dear Miguel, 
 Thanks for your quick response to my message. 
 I will like to know your country of residence, though myself and my husband has  no particular choice of country our primary concern is to help the needy no matter where he or she resides, in the light of the above, I would request to have your full details, example, your ID  be it national ID or national drivers licensee 
 Secondly full assurance from you that you are going to set up a charity/motherless babies home in your area of residence to take care of mostly the needy, because this is the wish of my late husband and I want someone who will carry it out to the later. 
 I want you to know that my health conditions is very bad and as such this project needs a very quick attention, so we must hurry up the process so that I can sign all documents for the transfer of all the money to you before I pass on. 
 Let it be known to you that once we agree on this, there are some other properties which I will hand over to you apart from the money.  I have two buildings here in Atlanta Georgia  and two Toyota Trucks, which I think will go a long way in helping you if taking to your country of residence. 
 As it stands now, I do not go out, my doctor comes to the house for my treatment, and while I wait unto my God for the day He will call me to His Glory. And finally, let me know if you can be able to raise like $1800 or there about to give to the lawyer for his initial take off for his legal works, as I will like him to be answerable to you from the beginning, do not fear as I am making available some funds for you as soon as the documents are completed, I will explain further on this as we go on. And lastly as soon as the agreement is completed I will give you the email address of our attorney so you can connect with him.

I will over and over again let you know that theres no risk whatsoever associated with this my dealings with you. Myself and my husband were never involved in any form of criminality/fraud in our life nor were we ever involved in any form of drug dealing. When all these are concluded you will know us better upon the reception our bank will accord you when all has been handed over to you. 
Secondly, if its about the $1800 that i told you send to the lawyer, do not entertain any fear as you will send him the money through bank transfer, my only fear is how fast can you do this, as it will be nice if i witness this things. According to the lawyer, this process should not take more a week before the court issues letter of administration on your name. 
So be confident as there are no risk involved. 
Lastly, please do forward to me your means of IdentificatioN (ID) and your full address.

He was a customer in my bank (Bank Of America) and he (late Mr. Andersen) deposited the sum of US$5M in my bank in the year 2013 and i have the photocopies of his fund's documents and will send it to you via email attachment to apply to my bank as the next of kin to the deceased person.
Late Mr. Andersen,  lived in Scotland. Just like I had feared, my efforts to trace his family members were unsuccessful since there was inadequate or rather, no information left by him about his family members. For two years (from 2021 till now). I have invested both time and money in my quest to trace his family tree but all my efforts have been futile.
My resolving to engage this measure to secure the notice from my bank in June 2023 that they will be effecting confiscation action on his account if there is non-appearance of a beneficiary before the end of June 2023. As a matter of fact, banking policy governing suspended accounts empowers the bank to confiscate his funds and remit it as residual to the government deposit account after 5 to 10 years as unclaimed or owner-less funds.
You may or may not be related to Mr. Andersen. However, that is my least concern at the moment. I have contacted you because you share the same last name with him and my intention is to present you to the bank as the bona fide beneficiary to his account after procuring and obtaining due legal documentation in the Courts.
You may be wondering how I would be able to fortify and consummate this deal but make no mistake; I have not insinuated that achieving this objective will be easy and simple. But all I can assure you is that with a proper and careful handling that we will come out successful.
Prior to sending you this email I have planned how best to execute this transaction and trust me, you can count on my proficiency. Let me remind you that this transaction will be conducted under legal procedural (LAW) to preclude us from infringement. Therefore, no atom of Risks or Consequences, legal or otherwise shall be met in the process of executing this matter hence our legal rights and protection shall be preserved prior and after receiving the fund.
In respect to the sharing, I have resolved a mutual sharing of 40% for you while 50% for me and the remaining 10% will be an unforeseen expenses that may occur during the funds processing / transfer. However this will be engraved in an agreement that both of us will sign to protect our interest, individually.
Please, if you have read, understood and are willing to cooperate with me to consummate this transaction please kindly let me know so that I will send you the photo copies of the funds documents.
You are hereby advised to provide me your information's such as:
*Int'l Passport or Drivers License for proper identification
*Full Name:
*Official address:
*Telephone number:

deeply and found out that your fund was delayed by the bankers that

in a high interest money program, this placement has made a high
profit of $15 Million USD which I can help you get, am an expert in
this sort of payments, I am a retired AA fund manager with European

during the high interest money program which is $15 Million USD.
If you would like me to proceed with the payment, do get back to me
with your current address and your phone numbers lets proceed.
I can have the fund moved to a Paying bank in America, then I will fly
down to America and have the fund paid to you locally, am an expert in

I am in receipt of your message, The problem with your fund was that it was used by the bankers who handled your payment and Paradigm Global LLC, they invested your money in a high interest money program without your consent and again it was placed on a private fund placement program on high interest with Royal Bank of Scotland.
These on-going programs since 2004-2011-2017 are being used by the bankers for their own personal interest without the consent of the fund owners including yourself. They keep using peoples money, and adding up to the millions they already have in the placement system whereby frustrating and delaying you to make you forget your fund.
The placement has made huge interest totaled US$15 Million in profits belongs to you,  I want to start by paying you this US$15 Million, then we can talk about rescuing the total sum.
I have secured the US$15 Million with a CDM Fund Coverage protecting it as an investment fund which must first be moved to  a paying bank in America as an investment fund, this is why I have not contacted you since, because they tried to assassinate me.  I will move it into a paying bank in America FIRST, and once the fund has arrived, I will fly down to America and have the fund transferred into your account directly.
But meanwhile I will like us to have an agreement signed before I commence with the transfer, I will forward to you a copy of my International passport and the agreement letter upon receipt of your confirmation/acknowledgement.
Lastly I have attached herein copy of the Bank Guarantee Issued to Paradigm Global LLC by Royal Bank of Scotland which the traded on with your fund, so get back to me urgently so that we can swing into action.

GOD WORK AND
CHARITY WORK
Am mrs Rosemary Smith, The  reason
for which I contacted you is to solicit for your service for uplifting
the orphans and underprivileged. I inherited this money from my late
husband. Mr Smith Adam  And I don’t know how much the accurate
interest on the money for the past few years the money has been lying
in the custody of the Bank. 15 million dollars, I have made up my
mind to entrust the fund in your care to be distributed to charitable
organisation in any country that mostly need some support and to
other. I want the money to reach the less privileged in the society,
especially the motherless children, the orphans and the handicapped. I
intended to keep the money for my adopted child but unfortunately, my
adopted child got involved in a bus accident while returning back from
school and he died. I finally made up my mind to donate out this fund
after being diagnosed of cancer by my doctor. That was few months ago.
Recently, my doctor insisted that I must go for surgical operation, or
else, it would get to uncontrollable stage. He also made me to
understand that my chances of surviving the operation would be 50/50
and that the surgery operation must be done. Based on that, I decided
that I have to WILL off the fund to the suffering children first
before going for the operation
In view of the above, I want you to assure me that you are going to
utilize this money that I am about to entrust in your care, that the
money would not be used in some other things that are not in line with
what I have proposed for the money. Please, I want you to write back
to me and acknowledge to me that the money must be used judiciously.
Once I receive your response to this message, and if your vision
towards this project is acceptable with me, I shall then put you in
contact with my late husband’s lawyer who is going to work hand in
hand with you for transfer of the money to you, because i may not be
able to communicate again once am placed on medical supervision for my
operation. I am waiting for your reply. My Email Address;

331,ik26864.json,Classifier,2023-04-23 12:13:13,"Dear Customer,
This is to bring to your notice that because of the impossibility of your fund through Banks, we have credited your total sum of $2.5million valid fund into an ATM MASTER CARD and the federal government authority has ordered the bank to re-activate the ATM Card without any activation fee which has been done already and the government  authority did it because the ATM Card worth of $2.500,000.00 which they have registered its delivery on Tuesday has less than 1year to expire and it is in the custody of the TNT Courier Company and when it expires, the money will go into Federal Government treasury account.
With that the government  authority  decided to waive the reactivation fee, so that the ATM Card will not expire, and it will be easy for you to receive your ATM Card immediately without any delay.
I was trying to contact you, but all to no avail which i was trying to confirm if you are still living in your formal address used for the registration of the ATM Card.
Now 
I want you to contact TNT Courier Company with your current address for the delivery to be made
, so that they can deliver the ATM Card to your designated address without any delay.
Like I stated earlier, the crediting, re-activation, delivery and the company registration charges has been settled by the government authority, but they did not pay TNT official keeping fees since they refused because the reason is that they do not know when you are going to contact TNT and they told me that TNT 
keeping fee is $40 only
, and it was deposited on 18th April 2023.
Below is the Contact Information of the TNT Courier Company,
TNT Director Mr. Amos Ken,
Email Address online: 
tntcourierservicecompany758@gmail.com
Contact them today and also send them the security official keeping charge to avoid increase of their fees and let me know once you receive your ATM card through gift cards such as steam wallet card, iTunes card or through Bitcoin wallet.
Important Notice, your ATM CARD package was registered as a gift so that the diplomatic Agent will not know the content of your package okay.
Yours Sincerely,
Mr.Nelson Abel

summary of your project. In order not to waste our times, I will give 
you  some basic information on the general outline of the process.
The principle terms for the loan procedure are as follows: -
Securitization:         Via Insurance Bond Guarantee (cost 3% of loan 
amount and can be agreed to be deducted from loan prior to disbursement 
- see below)
Est. Length of Loan:                         10 years + (TBC)
Moratorium on Interest:               0 to 36 months possible
Repayment:                                 At end of loan period
(which can be extended by mutual agreement) or pay back early the amount
of the Loan in minimum tranches of USD 500,000 without penalty.
Interest Rate:                                    2.5% per annum
Legal Jurisdiction:                             International
Regarding the Insurance Bond Guarantee - no other collateral, personal 
guarantee of share pledge is required. The Insurance Bond is put in 
place as the surety / security for the loan. In the instance (after 
""default notification"" and ""failure to remedy"") that a loan could 
potentially fully default the Insurance Bond is triggered in favor of 
the lender and pays back the majority of their loan. For the balance 
there is then a company valuation done on the Borrowers and Lender can 
trigger step-in rights for a proportion of the company shares. But this 
is a last resort always. The one off cost is 3% of the loan and is 
deducted from the loan amount and not required to be provided separately 
by the Borrower.
As with all lenders there are some fees ahead of drawdown that cannot be 
avoided or deferred. These will be outlined in the lenders Procedure 
document and indicatively they will be: -
o             Flat fee for legal and administration following loan 
approval at Board Level.
o             Variable fee for completion and closing costs    To be 
confirmed
Kindly get back to me with the executive summary of your proposal if 
these terms fit into the purview of your search for viable financing so 
we can proceed with the loan process.
I look forward to discussing with you further.
Best regards,
Jeff Newton

Attention Beneficiary,
Dear sir,
I am Mr. Michael Auckland from Monzo Bank Limited. we had just formed
a new forum which is the newly inaugurated World Debt Recovery
committee (WDRC). My committee has a mandate to recover unpaid debts
associated with NNPC contracts, Lottery fund, inheritance fund, loans
and grants etc ranging from $1M-$95.5M owed to various beneficiaries
and companies across the globe (Asia, Europe, USA, Africa, and
Australia) and submit the list of the unpaid beneficiaries/companies
to the 2 appointed official paying Banks for immediate payment of the
fund.
In the course of our investigation, your email address/particulars
were shortlisted among the first fifteen individuals yet to be paid
hence this email. However, we received a petition today from one
Mrs.Christina Morgan that you are dead. According to her, you died in
a plane crash as such your fund should be paid to her as the apparent
heir. She has also submitted her Bank account with Bank of America for
the transfer of the fund to her.
To avoid undue delay or paying the fund to wrong
individual/beneficiary, we have decided to contact you for
confirmation. If we fail to hear from you after 72 hours, it will be
assumed that the petition of Mrs. Morgan is true and the fund will be
paid to her without further delay.
Therefore, We would like you to choose below your choice of fund transfer:
(A) Bank Transfer/Online Banking

I write you as an independent financial consultant with the Central bank of Nigeria, which the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) asked to investigate some of the unclaimed payment of clients which they (FGN) believe should have been sorted out over the years, but for some reasons still remained unpaid.
It is my duty to investigate such case, and during my investigation I came across your unpaid claim file tagged FGN/CBN 3310-29281, and when I investigated further, I noticed what the problem was all about a simple policy, which with my office I can handle and get your name shortlisted for immediate payment.
However, it is imperative that I let you know what must be done with emphasis on the word “MUST” be done before you can be shortlisted for immediate release of your long-awaited payment.
You must provide the contract invoice for the payment you are claiming, in addition to that, you are to provide both the cross border clearance certificate and the non-money laundering clearance certificate as stipulated in the money laundering act of 2022.
Upon the receipt of these mentioned certificates and due verification, I will have your name shortlisted for the immediate release of your payment.
Please note that there is a provision now which allows you to receive your payment via cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) if you so wish.
Awaiting your urgent response and congratulations.

You keep asking the same question repeatedly and I have assured you that
this is a risk-free transaction. This transaction is about unclaimed funds
in one of our commercial banks. I got to know about it since a directive
was issued by the Federal Government of Nigeria directing the Central Bank
of Nigeria to call back all unclaimed payments from all commercial banks to
the treasury, which means that beneficiaries of such funds will never have
access to their payment again.
I do not know why your email was in this particular file and the amount is
$18.750M and I have this urge to go into partnership with you and get the
payment paid out to any designated bank account you provide as the
beneficiary of the funds.
I have written assuring you that since I am the director in charge of this
payment, everything required to get this to a successful conclusion is not
going to be an issue.
I need you to include your mobile/WhatsApp Number to this email, so I can
explain the procedure better to you.

Furthermore, I would like to know if you are aware of Mr. Paul Morgan, who has been contacting on your behalf in regard to your payment value sum of $10.5Million and the information reaching us according to Mr. Paul Morgan is that you have been diagnosed with lung cancer and may not survive from it, so please did you authorized him to come and claim your payment as your next of kin and business partner. We have refused to make payment to him because we are not sure if this is true, so we have to contact you first to verify from you. So, get back to us now because we are very shocked with the information we received from him, and we don't know how he got to know about your $10.5Million contract/inheritance fund.
Therefore, if truly you are not aware of him, we would like to know how you wish to receive your ATM master card value sum of $10.5Million along with your four digits Pin code number as soon as possible. For your information you can come down here to our bank in Nigeria to pick up your ATM master card directly from my office or alternatively we can send it to you through any reliable courier shipping company at your own cost. But we don’t know the cost of shipping the card to you but if you will permit, we can make an inquiry from the courier shipment company to find out the cost once we receive a positive response from you but in that case, you will be required to forward your shipping address to enable us find out the shipment cost to your address.
Please do not hesitate to call me on +234-8181325542 as soon as you read this message so as to enable us to facilitate your payment now that your fund has been finally Approved, you are hereby advised to desist from any further communication with whoever you are in contact with both local and international regarding your payment to avoid unexpected diversion of funds and wrong delivery of your ATM MASTER CARD to an unknown person.
Note: Our bank will not be held responsible for any further delay in regard to your payment through ATM Master Card and you are advised to comply on time if you are not the one that sent this person that claims to be your partner.

Dear Friend,
Seeing this email message would be a surprise to you but kindly read
it carefully and you will understand the reason why I am contacting
you for this purpose. However, this correspondence is UN-official and
private, and it should be treated as such. I also guarantee you that
this transaction is hitch free from all what you may think of. I am
Mr. Ming Mui, Vice President & Branch Manager, Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (USA) NY, Canal Street Main Branch, New York
and I am contacting you based on Trust and confidentiality that will
be attached to this transaction.
The Management and the Legal department of our bank (Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (USA) NY) in a recent meeting recommended
that the account of late Mr. William Aucoin, who was one of my branch
depositors, should be declared Dormant, confiscated and the
depositor's fund sent to the Bank Treasury according to U.S.A Banking
and financial law. Late William Aucoin died on 28th June 2010 of
cancer at the Aventura Hospital and Medical Center in Aventura,
Florida. The bank, having made several efforts to contact any of his
relatives to claim this money but without success decided to
confiscate the fund and declare it public fund.
Late Mr. William Aucoin was an account holder in my branch; he owns a
dollar account with a huge sum of money deposited in a Secret account
with my branch. In fact, since his death, no next of kin of the
account holder nor any relative of him has shown up for the claim of
this fund, this is because he has the account as a secret account
thus, he left all the documents for the deposit with me as his account
officer and financial advisory.
This is where I am interested and where I want you to come in, I want
you to come in as a relative of the deceased; do not bother that you
are not in any way related to him because I am in position to affix
your name as the next of kin to the deceased and no one will question
it since I am the officer in charge of the account. I will give you
the relevant documents and contacts to file the application and then I
will effect the approvals for the transfer of the fund to your
nominated bank account. I will be the one to provide the vital
documents for the claims of the money and then advise you exactly how
we should handle it.
Please include your telephone number when replying to this mail so I
can call to give you more information as soon as you indicate your
willingness to assist in this transaction. The whole Procedures will
last only 14 working days to get the fund retrieved successfully
without trace even in future. After the transfer of the money to your
nominated bank account, we shall share the money 50-50.that is I will
have 50% while you will have 50%.
Kindly respond promptly so that I can advise you on what to do next.

Thank you for your reply to my proposal.
Like I told you in my first message, I am a member of the Contract Award
and Procurement Committee of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation
Limited (NNPC).
The US22,000,000.00 in question was accrued from Over-invoiced Contract
that was awarded by the Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and executed by a
foreign firm to Service, Turn Around Maintenance and Rehabilitation Work on
Port-Harcourt Refinery and Petrochemical Company Plant in Nigeria.
Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we intend to
transfer to any foreign bank account you will provide.
It is based on this that my colleagues and I have decided to establish a
cordial business relationship with you, hence my contacting you. We will
present you/your company as the Beneficiary to this fund by securing all
the necessary approvals legally from NNPC and the Federal Ministry of
Finance (FMF) respectively, so that the funds can be released into your
account for safety and subsequent investment.
Please, note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk free. The contract
payment shall be released to you legally under the approval and authority
of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN). We will commence the
transaction from the date of receipt of the following information from you.
1. Your Personal Telephone
2. Your Company Name And Address
3. Your Bank Name And Full Address, Bank Account Number, Swift Code or
Routing Numbers, where you would want the money transferred into.
With this information, we are going to secure all the necessary approval
documents in your favour for the release of this funds (US22M) into your
account. I will send copies of the approval documents to you for record
purposes as soon as they are secured.
We have agreed to share the money thus:
1. 40% for the account owner (you)
2. 60% for me and my Colleagues
As you are aware, we intend to invest our own share of the funds in any
good project/business with good Return on Investment (ROI) that you may
suggest to us once the contract funds has been released and confirmed in
your bank account. I absolutely HOLD YOU ON TRUST.
Should you have any questions/worries, please do not hesitate to ask.
I await your response.

I am interested in learning more about the necessary approvals legally required from NNPC and the Federal Ministry of Finance FMF to release the funds into my account.
In order to proceed, I would need more information about your company and the contract in question. Could you please provide me with more details about the contract, including the name of the foreign firm that executed it? Additionally, I would need to know more about your company and its role in the contract.

My Name is Kimberly Wolfe.I am an international model, my age of 29,
Single, No kid. I live alone here in Edmonton, North London, United
Kingdom. My Origin is Corinth, (Texas). I am the only daughter of my
parents, my father died in a fatal auto accident on his way to see my
aged sick mother at the hospital where she was admitted for Cancer
treatments, my mother also died when she heard about the death of my
father the same day at the hospital.
Before the death of my father, he had Willed part of his Real Estate
Business, Petrol Stations and a total sum of £50,700,000.00 (Fifty
Million, Seven Hundred Thousand Pounds Sterling) to me.I went to the
bank where my late father deposited the funds on my behalf to withdraw
some amount of money to take care of myself and pay for my other
bills.
I was shocked when the Bank Manager explained to me that I will not be
able to withdraw from the deposited money, because my late father had
put a clause on the Will, which he used in depositing the funds with
them, saying that before I will be given access to the money, I will
either have to be 30 years old or I will be given access to the money

of trust so we can achieve this deal together. This transaction will

claim these funds on my behalf. Email me here:

I am sorry to hear about the loss of your parents. However, I cannot help you with your request.

Attention, Beneficiary..
Dear sir,
I am Mr. Michael Auckland from Monzo Bank Limited. we had just formed
a new forum which is the newly inaugurated World Debt Recovery
committee (WDRC). My committee has a mandate to recover unpaid debts
associated with NNPC contracts, Lottery fund, inheritance fund, loans
and grants etc ranging from $1M-$95.5M owed to various beneficiaries
and companies across the globe (Asia, Europe, USA, Africa, and
Australia) and submit the list of the unpaid beneficiaries/companies
to the 2 appointed official paying Banks for immediate payment of the
fund.
In the course of our investigation, your email address/particulars
were shortlisted among the first fifteen individuals yet to be paid
hence this email. However, we received a petition today from one
Mrs.Christina Morgan that you are dead. According to her, you died in
a plane crash as such your fund should be paid to her as the apparent
heir. She has also submitted her Bank account with Bank of America for
the transfer of the fund to her.
To avoid undue delay or paying the fund to wrong
individual/beneficiary, we have decided to contact you for
confirmation. If we fail to hear from you after 72 hours, it will be
assumed that the petition of Mrs. Morgan is true and the fund will be
paid to her without further delay.
Therefore, We would like you to choose below your choice of fund transfer:
(A) Bank Transfer/Online Banking
(B) Certified Bank Draft/Cheque
(C) ATM Card
(D) Consignment
Your full personal information is also required as below which will be
needed for the transfer of your fund.
(A) Full name and residential address
(B) Next of kin
(C) Occupation
(D) Nationality
(E) Bank Account Information
(F) Telephone numbers
(G) Scan the first page of your international passport or drivers

Your urgent response is always required because you have a limited
time to execute this fund.

The current price for a gold nugget bar is $44,000 USD. The price is less
because you are buying the community offer price,this offer is going to
last till the end of this month.
The negotiable discount depends on the quantity of Gold bar or Gold dust
that you are buying. This is the reason I asked to know the quantity so I
can tell you the discount attached.
I understand an American has just arrived in Uganda this morning and was
received by our team at the airport for gold purchase also. If you wish to
speak to him concerning how his trip was, I can help get his contact
details.
We are honest and sincere people in Uganda with a high level of hospitality
for our foreign business partners and customers.You will be happy to do
business with us.

any information you desire so we can move to the next step.

Thank you very much for your response to my earlier message, Please how are you and yours doing today? kindly bear with me over this unexpected message from me to you as it is after a very deep considerable thought that one has to take a risk to confide in someone to succeed sometime in life, therefore I hope with this explanation you will understand better my purpose of contacting you. Please read carefully and patiently.
In June 2015, one of our foreign customers made a Fixed deposit for 36 calendar months, valued at US$35,500,000.00 in our bank where l am head of accounts department.
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After waiting several months, we sent a reminder and finally discovered from his contract employers that he and his family died in a plane crash.
On further investigation, I found out that he died without leaving a WILL and all attempts to trace extended members of his family were never successful. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that he did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents in his Bank Deposit paperwork at my Bank.
His money (US$35,500,000.00 ) has been floating as unclaimed since maturity and all efforts to get his relatives have proved unsuccessful. According to our banking policy, if such money continues to remain unclaimed, the money will be passed to the coffers of the Central bank treasury unclaimed bill.
It's been many years now and nobody has shown up for the money. My proposal to you is that l want you to cooperate with me to enable us to claim the money so we can both use it for investment . I will put all the necessary documents together to make you the next of kin so that the money will be paid to you. I have secured from the probate court an order of mandamus to locate any family member of the deceased so that the money can be paid to him or her, but still no success.
If you agree to cooperate with me, after successful execution of this deal, we shall share the money in percentage of 50/50. I assure you that this deal is 100% risk free, you don't have to fear anything as l am a professional in Real Estate Banking / Family Wealth
If you are interested in engaging in this deal, please respond in earliest upon reception of this message so I can confidently explain to you more
Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
Jean-Jacque Kwame

Thank you for reaching out to me. I am doing well, thank you for asking. I appreciate you sharing this opportunity with me, but I must admit I am a bit skeptical. Can you provide me with more information about the bank and the customer who made the fixed deposit? Also, what percentage are you proposing we split the money in? I am interested in learning more, but I want to make sure everything is legitimate before moving forward.

Thanks for your response and your readiness to work with me on this matter. First and foremost, let me reassure you, that this is a 100% legal transaction. People around the world claim on their late relatives estate on a daily basis and this is just one of such claims - only this time, you are not related with the deceased and working with a bank insider (me), who was the deceased account officer.
I will provide you, with all relevant documents and guide you through the claim process and we share the funds at a 50/50 ratio after claim. I will guide you through the probate application and the only thing, that can fuck this deal is, if at any point during the claim process, you open up to somebody and my bank gets to know, that you are not related to the deceased depositor. That will not only ruin my career, but might as well earn me some jail time for misrepresentation/falsification of information, to defraud the bank. Other than that, if you agree to work with me, and keep this transaction confidential, we can claim these funds in less than 10 banking days, if you follow instructions and do as I tell you. So, for a start, you have to give me your full details:
* Full name
* Age or Date of birth
* Occupation
* Address
* Telephone number/WhatsApp
The process is simple, it starts with a false alarm to my colleagues, that a relative of the deceased contacted me and I have asked you, to send an email. I will give you a text draft, that you will send to the appropriate Dept., once you send the email, I will check and find your name in our file, which I have already created with above details, which I will submit for approval. Then you go through probate, to get a letter of administration (I will guide you, on how to go about that) and submit it to the bank and direct them to transfer the funds to your designated bank account. The funds are currently in a suspense account with our bank Banque Atlantique Group, Abidjan.
I will guide you with more details, when you reply to this mail. The only area, I might need your financial assistance is in the legal fees. We need a ""Letter of Administration"" from the Court
and a lawyer is required, to file the ""Affidavit of Death"" to the Probate Court, to obtain the ""Letter of Administration"".
This will cost some money and that's the only area, I will be needing your assistance, which I am certain, that both of us can handle, without any difficulties. If you are ready and willing to proceed, please respond with the above details and please find my WhatsApp number below.

Attention Mary
This fund in question, was intended to be delivered to you by a
diplomat but we don't know if you are aware or not before the fund was
stopped during transit here in USA, because the delivering system was
wrong, the Tag and ownership certificate that is placed on the
consignment box containing the fund bears your name and your email
address, that is why we are able to contact you now that the
Government has instructed us to release all seized items to their
owners.
I will like to bring to your notice that your present is highly
needed, because you will have to sign the fund release order
certificate before the fund will be finally hand over to you.
But if you cannot come because of the distance, we will have to
contract a lawyer that will sign it on your behalf in our regional
office in PENNSYLVANIA and this unit will take care of the lawyer
charges according to the instruction from the Government.
As soon as the lawyer signs it on your behalf, we will send the fund
to you through FedEx delivery company to the address which you have to
provide to us.
Therefore you are required to reconfirm your mailing address such as
home or office address to avoid mistake in delivery. But if you know
you can come, feel free and come to the address above.

I'm glad we can connect here. I'm Philip Roger, a Research Assistant of the Research and Development Department working with Med Pharmaceutical Laboratories UK, One of the leading Bio Pharmaceutical Companies here in England. I'm looking for a reliable businessman/individual in your region to represent my company in sourcing some of our basic raw material used in the manufacturing of high quality Anti-Viral Vaccines, Cancer treatment and other life saving Pharmaceutical Products.
This may not be your area of specialization but it will be another income generating business out of your specialty. This is because our company is yet to locate any seller to buy from, however, I have been able to discover a local dealer who can supply us with this product. He is selling at a cheap rate , which is far more cheaper than our previous purchases.
My director is not yet aware that I have found a new seller. Now THIS IS MY PROPOSAL TO YOU; I want you to stand in as a new local dealer from your country and I will introduce you to our company. The reason for this is because I don't want my company to have direct contact with the local agent that sells this  excipient very cheaply.
This will enable us to work together as partners and make real cool profits. You as the local seller will supply to our company at a good rate which I will inform you later when we are in agreement and This will attract the attention of our company director to buy from you as against the previous rate . You will be amazed with our total profit .
I will give you more specific profit details when I receive feedback from you if you are interested.

610,oc23304.json,Chat2,2023-04-29 16:40:09,"Dear Mr. Mandy ,
Thank you for your response.  Yes, I am interested.
Secondly,  my  options are limited, yours is not, but I  have realized that
I   simply have to trust you more and the risk for me  is quite high if you
 decide to back out of the project or take any further actions contrary  to
my  intention/plan, I do hope you understand this and take it  graciously?
I have everything to lose  and  we have to be  wise on how  we proceed
because, you have  nothing to lose at this stage or even at a  later stage
, I therefore  have to be a bit  cautious as to what vital  information I
release to you until I am sure of your commitment to fully  co-operation
with me.
Due  to sensitive nature of my status as an asylum seeker and what we are
 planning to do, we should be carefully about who we discuss the proposed
 project with, I suggest that you think wisely and act wisely so that  you
do not jeopardize my future, I have trusted you all this far, you  have to
also trust me, without mutual trust, we shall fail in the  project due to
your indented mistake.
After  giving careful thought to the focus of your message, I then decided
to  give you a little information about me, my late father as well as how
 the investment funds came about.
1,Because  of the ongoing problem in my country South Sudan and the
investment  funds purpose  are presently in   South Africa but for the fear
of  seizure , since the South African exchange policy does  not allow
person  of my status for such investment , hence I am an asylum seeker , I
am  saddled with the responsibility of searching for a trustworthy and
 honest person I should entrust my future on his/her hand  that could
 assist me with investment.
2,That the acquisition of this fund was made possible by my late father
during his lifetime under our ex-president.
Please  be sure to respect our gentleman’s agreements /understanding, I
expect  better from you in terms of confidentiality, I want you to keep an
open  mind pending when we eventually meet each other, even when we
presently  do not know ourselves and I do believe that soon, that will be
in the  past, right now, we all keep a level and mature head, do not panic
for  any reason, we are matured people  and we should be able to control
our  project by doing the necessary things quietly and precisely, our risk
of  failure is zero, only if you could be calm about what you are involved
 in with me.
Your  role in the scheme of things once again is underscored, only to allow
 me to work with you in pushing the project through for our
 mutual/collective benefit.
 A SHORT FAMILY PROFILE OF MY LATE FATHER ENGR,MATTHEW  H. DAKU,
 My late father of blessed memory was sent here to South Africa   to buy
arms and ammunition during war.in the  process there was a coup and the
president was overthrown and my father  was recalled and in the process, he
was killed, but before he died he  told me about  this funds
 In  light of the above scenario I then decided to insert a residual
 beneficiary, through whom I could facilitate the investment with me  since
I am an asylum seeker
Please  understand this and contact me, if you are ready and truly willing
to  co-operate and follow my instruction regarding the project at hand and
 the best steps to take to achieving success, which my possession as next
 of kin to the estate is guaranteed, the transfer of the investment fund
 would only take a week  to Two  working  days to be finalized and I  shall
keep you acquainted on the procedure to take when you get  back to  me.
 Your early response will be appreciated.
Thanks and God bless you.

Date: 03:05:23
ATTENTION: BENEFICIARY ,
                          YOUR OUTSTANDING PAYMENT.
We hereby bring to your notice that your outstanding payment with the Federal Government of Nigeria has reached this office for verification and clarifications before the release. Without wasting much time, I have personally investigated this payment down to the Ministry where this contract was executed and from my findings it is clear that you did not execute this contract in question, from all available information, it looks like some officials in the Ministry were trying to use you to claim this particular value which they over invoiced for their own selfish interest. I know it might interest you to know how I managed to find out this truth, yes. I investigated this payment up to the ministry where this contract was executed and after some checks I was surprised to see that the most vital/important documents regarding this contract bear a different name and beneficiary.
Based on this I decide to contact the supervisor that signed the attestation report, on getting to the contract award and supervisory commission I collected the contract attestation report and found out that this document still bears the name: B&B PETROLEUM ENG.PTY as the company that executed this contract. I kept this to myself and came down to my base. As a matter of fact I have been thinking if to report my findings to the appropriate body for cancellation of this payment, but I have this second thought of contacting you since I am not a saint and in a position to approve this payment for the president to give go ahead order to the release, I feel this might be a Gods given opportunity.
So based on this I am writing to you, if you will accept my  conditions I can normalize all the relevant papers of this payment and the funds will be released within 14 working days. Contract attestation report is not in your name, the fund ownership certificate is also not in your name. Actually your partners, as I should say, did a very great job in manipulating almost all the documents to your favor.
Now, I want you to know that, with my position, I can amend this problem and this money will be paid to your nominated bank account which both of us will share on a 50/50 %if only you will accept my conditions. So, if you see it wise to get this perfected with me feel free.
I shall let you know my conditions as soon as I hear from you.
Thanks.

dont want to share your own information with me.
i have already told you all you needed to know about me and if you really

information about yourself, now it is your turn to tell me more about
yourself.
i am listening.

me any information about yourself in attachments like your photo, ID copy
of explain more about yourself to me,
furthermore, if you can't provide any financial assistance to me when you
know very well the situation in Ukraine right now and how desperate i am in
need of financial help, then you will realize that i am not here to play
jokes or have you wasting my time asking too many questions to me which you
already have all the answers you needed from me.
my question is which country are you communicating from?
What is your age?
Are you married ?
Do you have children?
What is your occupation?
if you really want to help me then you will have to understand that
receiving my money US$1.5Million requires funding to fund it to your
account which whatever you contribute to ensuring the transfer of my money
is successfully completed to your account, you will take US$150.000 usd
from the US$1.5Million when transferred to your account.
If you wish to proceed further and help me anyhow you can then you will
have to contact my banker today and comply with his instructions.

I have to inform you again, that we are not playing over this, I know
my reason for the continuous sending of this notification to you, the
fact is that you can't seem to trust any one again over this payment
for what you have been in cantered in many months ago, but
 I want you
to trust me, I cannot scam you for $100 it is for bank processing of
your payment, the fees of $100 is clearly written to you before, I did
not invent the bill to defraud you of $100 it is an official bank
payment processing fee, and the good part of this, is that you will
never, ever be disturbed again over any kind of payment, this is
final, and the forms from there becomes effective once we submit your
payment application processing fee and pay the form fee of $100 cannot
scam you for $100 this time
, because you may never get another such
good opportunity, the federal government is keen and very determined
to pay your overdue debts, this is not a fluke, I would not want you
to loose this fund out of ignorance, I will send you all the documents
as soon as bank payment processing fee is paid, you have to trust me, you will
get your fund,
find a way to get $100 you will not loose it, instead it will bring
your financial breakthrough, find the money and send it to our
bursary. The reason why am sending you this because I want you to
receive your USD15.5M immediately we are trying to round up for this
payment program.
The processing charges which was initially on the high price has been
cut down by the payout bank considering the poor economic situations
that make it difficult for the middle class citizens to meet up with
the processing charges of their entitlement. Upon the confirmation of
your processing charges you will get your $15.500, 000.00 into your
account within 15hrs. Here is the payment information through iTunes card
finally my advice to you is not to abandon this transaction because of the
requirement of($100) A tracking number will be issued to you once your package
is deposited.
I want you to buy steam wallet gift card of $100USD, so that we will
finalize this transaction once and for all, go to any nearest store
around you and buy the iTunes  card and scratches it then send the
copy.

Head Officer-in-Charge
Administrative Service Inspection Unit
I am Mr. David Morris, Head Officer-in-Charge, and Administrative Service
Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Harts field-Jackson
International Airport Atlanta, Georgia.
During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a
Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport
to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an
undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately
110kg each.
The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared
by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal
Effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent
or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to
pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the
consignment is delayed and abandoned.
By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They are
still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments
like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal
dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective Capacity: 680 L) Approximately.
The details of the consignment including your name and email on the
official document from United Nations' office in London where the shipment
was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with
us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your, Full name, Phone Number,
full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on
the official documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need
the consignment or allow us repatriate it back to UK (place of origin) as
we were instructed.
Like I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most
importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the
yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s) etc. I
am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this packages
provided you will also give me something out of it (financial
gratification). You can either come in person, or you engage the services
of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary
security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the
destination of your choice. I need the entire guarantee that I can get from
you before I can get involved in this project.

I am deeply sorry for responding late to your email and am so happy you got my message and confirm you are still alive with your email active.
In accordance with my religious persuasion, I felt it expedient to write and inform you of the wicked conspiracy hatched by some of the corrupt government officials in the Ministry of Finance and some of the Finance Ministry staff in Africa and their cohorts around the world to divert your money to their designated account in Europe.
From my position here as a clerk in this office, I discovered that they moved the fund from Africa to London, UK and then moved it last week to Banco Italiano in ITALY. Today I found out through the Central computer database that they are about to re-route back your fund to a security company in the USA. With this, I felt that it is important for me to alert you on this development.
They are still using your name and contract/inheritance identification number as the beneficiary but they have changed the account co-ordinate and this is the reason they are frustrating you by asking for endless fees in order to buy time pending on when they will transfer your funds to their designated account in Cayman Islands.
I have the reference number of the transaction and also I have the number of the official who is directly in charge at the SECURITY COMPANY in the USA.
Your payment is supposed to go through the UK credit control financial clearing house before final Lodging into the security company there in the USA. All the data about your claim profile are within my reach. I do not need gratification from you either in cash or kind. I can never be a part of evil.
Please respect my discretion in this matter, you can send an email to me so that I can give you the reference number and the name and contact information of the official of the security company in the USA. I repeat, Please do not expose my personality, it is not easy to get jobs around here and I cannot contend with these powerful individuals because they can eliminate me just like that. reply to me through my private email (dennisbellofficial@aol.com) if you are interested in getting your long overdue payment.

I greet you with warm regards. I earn a living in the oil industry as leader of the Procurement Unit in a refining outfit owned by a Sao Tome and Principe government. I currently reside in the United Kingdom and work as a liaison officer to the government
On my desk is a mandate to arrange for crude oil purchase for up to 500,000 barrels on every other month basis for 2 calendar years. The essence of my reaching out to you is the fact that as a staff, it is against Sao Tome government operational ethics to profiteer from any dealings with any oil purchasing firm hence the reason I need a trustworthy middle person outside my work circle to stand as the oil AGENT or BROKER so we can get all the commission paid to us for all the oil purchases.
I will guide you as an insider to obtain the required oil License certification from the National Petroleum Agency of Sao Tome and Principe (NPA-STP) .If you are interested to partner with me on this, we can achieve this license and registration with the NPA-STP in your name in less than 10 working days once the application is submitted. Worry less about purchases as I already have some firms who are ready to purchase oil but do not have any credible licensed agent to broker for them as required.
As soon as I hear from you today confirming your interest, I shall prepare and send to you a draft copy of the MOU between you and I before we can start the process of acquiring the Oil Agency/ Brokerage License.
Please ensure that you reply to this email address:  
csalvaterra0001@gmail.com
Thank you and Kind regards.

Thank you for reaching out to me with this opportunity. I am interested in learning more about this oil purchasing deal and potentially partnering with you as the broker. Can you please provide me with more details about the process of obtaining the oil license and the commission structure for the broker? 
Once I have more information, I can make an informed decision about moving forward with this opportunity.

712,py87315.json,Chat2,2023-04-25 12:30:34,"Dear Gerald,
Thanks for your mail in response to the proposal I sent to you. I will also
be very pleased to have you as a partner and wish to assure you that with
your cooperation, we will be able to complete this project in no time.
As i informed you, i am in possession of an existing oil lifting license
from the island of Sao Tome and Principe which i can use my position in the
oil and gas company here to reallocate to your company's name or personal
name since the original operator Mr. Kim from South Korea is dead. This
license has been issued since 2007 and till now is still valid for use.
The only thing that is required from you is to have your company name or
personal name registered and paid for with the Sao Tome and Principe
corporate affairs commission as a P.L.P company specializing in oil lifting
and with the certificate of company registration in your company name, i
will be able to reassign the license to your name or your company's name. I
believe that since we are about to go into a long lasting business
relationship, we have to be sincere to each other to achieve the greater
goal. To this end, I have to inform you that the only fee that will be
required in this venture will be the company registration fee to have your
company name registered as a P.L.P company and where you are not in a
position to assist with the fee, I will get one of my friends to assist us
with the fee so that we will proceed.
I also have to inform you that the crude oil allocated to this license has
been fully paid for by the previous operator and whatever amount that is
paid by the buyer each month will be shared between me and you at the
sharing percentage of 40% for you and 60% for me. We will only be required
to pay 3% royalty to the oil company and this will be paid when we have
received the payment for the crude oil from the buyer into the account that
you will provide.
I have already made arrangements with a prospective buyer who is willing to
pay upfront for the lifting of the crude allocated to this license for the
month of May as long as the license is presented in your name. You can
therefore make arrangements for the buyers of subsequent allocations once
the first payment gets through. You will also provide the account where
this payment will be made once the license is reissued to your name. Once
any payment is made and transferred to your bank account, I will come over
to your country for the sharing of the payment according to the agreed
percentage. You should therefore have nothing to fear as this is a genuine
and risk free transaction.
To prove the genuineness of this project, I am hereby sending you a copy of
my company identity and a copy of the original operator's passport. Go
through it and get back to me so that I will inform you of the information
that is required to get the company registration forms.  I will also get
the company registration forms and send them to you to fill and send back
once we have agreed. You can call me as soon as you have received this
email on my telephone number +447459724402

This is to inform you that  I am currently in Nigeria  not too long
ago with the un official envoy  to discuss Sudan crisis with the
African leaders in the person of Muhammadu  Buhari Nigeria president
on the way forward to end The Sudan conflict is complex, with multiple
actors involved and competing interests at play. It is not a simple
case of rebels versus the government, but rather a web of ethnic,
political, and economic tensions. One of the main causes of the
conflict is the unequal distribution of resources in Sudan
The international community has repeatedly called on Sudan's warring
parties to immediately lay down their arms and engage in dialogue.
More than 420 people have been killed and over 3,700 others have been
wounded in the conflict, according to the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean
Regional Office. please i will write you more by tomorrow Ok i need to
have some rest now  i promised to provide you with any information's
need to know about ok . You can reach me on +234 80 25 14-14-10.

My name is Mr. Anthony Walters, I am a Branch Manager of a Bank here in
Nigeria, West Africa, 
I got your information during my research on the
Internet.
 It may interest you to hear that I am a man of PEACE and don't
want problems, I only hope we can assist each other. If you don't want this
business offer kindly forget it, as I will not contact you again.
It may surprise you to receive this letter from me, since there has been no
previous correspondence between us.  I will also like to make it clear here
l know that the internet has been grossly abused by criminal minded
people making it difficult for people with genuine intention to correspond
and exchange views without skepticism.
I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit both of us. As a
Branch Manager of the Bank, it is my duty to send in a Financial Report to
my head office in Lagos at the end of each year.
In the course of the last year 2022 end of the year report, I discovered
that my branch where I am the Manager made an excess profit of
[US$10,500,000.00] which my head office is not aware of and will never be
aware of. I have since placed this fund in an ESCROW ACCOUNT.
As a staff of the bank I cannot be directly linked to this money, so this
made me to contact you for us to work together so that you can assist me
and receive this fund into your bank account for us to SHARE.
I am offering you 40% of the total fund, while you keep 60% for me in your
bank account till I join you for the sharing/investment of my own share of
the funds or we can go into a joint partnership venture, I will appreciate
It is very much.
As soon as I receive your response through this Address
( 
waltersanthony557@gmail.com
 ) I will give you more details on how we can
achieve it successfully.
This is 100% risk free and 100% legal
 and your earliest response to this
matter would be highly appreciated,
Yours Sincerely,
Mr. Anthony Walters.

you previously in my first message, that this transaction is 100% risk free
and legal. I am telling you nothing but the absolute truth, because if
there is any risk in this transaction definitely it will affect me and also
tarnish my image as well as bring my reputation down here in Nigeria which
is a big shame to me.
Be rest assured that every legal modalities about this transaction has been
mapped out and carefully arranged, so kindly relax your mind and let's work

discovered that my branch which I am The Operations Manager made excess
profit to the tune of [US$10,500,000.00] and my head office is not aware of
and will never be aware of it. So, this fund does not belong to any
individual and there are no risks involved in claiming the funds.
Therefore, I assure you that we both will be happy at the end with your
full cooperation.
However, I cannot be directly connected to this money because I still work
with the bank therefore, I have set up an ESCROW ACCOUNT without any
beneficiary and deposited the funds in the account and I decided to contact
you for us to work together to secure the funds in your name, so that when
you apply for the transfer, our head office will approve your application.
I am very happy that you have accepted this proposal therefore, I am
prepared to go into a joint partnership venture with you and I will offer
you 40% of the total funds while you will keep 60% for me in your account
till I join you with my family for further investment plans.
Please as you reply, let me have the following information to enable me to
work on the account information and draft the Application Letter of Claim
which you will complete and send to our bank head office for onward
approval for the transfer of the funds to any bank account of your choice.

3. Your date of birth: .............................
4. Marital status: ..............................

the sharing of the fund, I'm willing to part 40% of the fund to you for
your assistance and 55% for me while the remaining 5% will be for any
expenses incurred during the process of transfer, if you wish we can go
into partnership venture as I have requested.
Please treat confidentiality and always reply to this email for our
security; I will expect the above information as soon as possible.

I want you to contact DHL DELIVERY SERVICE with your Full Contact information so that they can deliver your ATM Card to your designated address also make sure that you send your full name and your phone number Like I stated earlier the delivery charges has been paid but the only fee you have to pay now is the official keeping fee which will cost you only $98 only.

822,rv02741.json,Classifier,2023-04-09 08:13:01,"  Dear beneficiary:
I am writing this letter once again to clarify my stand in this matter (Your Abandoned funds) and first and foremost i want you to understand that i am a very contented man and i am not interested in your consignment but i feel i can help you by telling you the real truth and why your consignment is been abandoned here.
Like as i rightly said before, your fund is 100% real and legal and you have every right to receive your fund as soon as the LETTER ON FUNDS RELEASE fee is paid to the airport authorities as law demand which will allow them to issue me a GATE Pass/Clearance Permit for me to bring your funds to your doorstep without any hitch.
Secondly, you cannot expect me to remove a cent out of the abandoned consignment that is been investigated by the united nations and the airport authorities without due process or without paying for the  LETTER ON FUNDS RELEASE fee of $1,750 that will enable me to bring your consignment out of the security vault.
One thing i understood about this life is that people hate the truth and prefer wasting their hard earn resources due to cheap promise from hoodlums.
I have taken my time to explain the reason why the diplomat assigned to deliver your consignment abandoned it and i have equally backed it up with the scanned photographic view during our investigation and instead of you to proffer a solution that will speed up the process so that i can bring the consignment to you by myself and you are there repeating the same issue.
However if you lose your abandoned consignment now, it will be called back to the national treasury and it will not stop me to do my official work, So i will advise you to have a second thought about this as time is running out of hands here due to numerous assignment on our hands now as i am willing to do my own part if you are ready to receive your consignment because i cannot move your consignment out of the security post at the airport without showing them the  LETTER ON FUNDS RELEASE payment receipt as it is a compulsory receipt here.
Having said this, you will be responsible for the Domestic LETTER ON FUNDS RELEASE clearance which cost $1,750; i will forward you the information of the receiver here.
I have helped so many beneficiaries in this matter and today they are all happy and i am happy too, so make up your mind and tell yourself that i want to receive my consignment, there we put heads together and offset the LETTER ON FUNDS RELEASE charge which you cannot compare with the value of the consignments.
Think about it and get back to me as soon as you read this urgent message as we are submitting our report any moment from now and once we close your file and submit the report, you can never receive your funds again.

I am resending this message to you for the last time because you might think it's one of those junk mails without knowing it's what will benefit you.
This message I am resending to you kindly give it a deep thought before responding back to me and note this process cost money but the only good thing about the process  it's doesn't cost much and you pay once not like other government officials that demands payment after payment.
I am Engr.Jide Jalowo.I have just resumed in Central Bank Of Nigeria (CBN) remittance department here as the Senior Engineer in charge of CBN computer/Control Room.
During a recent close study of information in our Central Computer Hard Disc,I discovered a floating amount  which represent your overdue payment But no one is opting to receive these funds or asking about it with keen interest but it was later i find out that some officials  wanted to divert your fund That was why i take this opportunity to ask why you have abandoned this payment and to know if you would need my assistance in any way to remit part of the money to you.
Your payment must have passed through all normal Central Bank Of Nigeria Payment procedures to get to the remittance department, meaning that there is no major reason for further delay in transferring your funds. Hence, I know that you may be faced with the problem of ""whom do you know""?
I know I can help you by gradual remittance process of about $150,000.00 to $300,000.00 in each transaction with a ""Proxy Disk"".But it has to be kept confidential because this is a  personal
 arrangement and nobody knows it except me and i will do it perfectly and you will receive your fund once you promise to keep it confidential!Let me know what you think about this.I will need a scan copy of your international passport or national id card/ drivers license, any of this three is accepted.
As I have stated above that this payment process cost money if you know your not ready to comply kindly don't reply because I will not respond to you.
Please re/confirm your account detail to avoid making  transfer to wrong account.
Remain Bless,
 Engr.Jide Jalowo

Can you provide me with any proof or documentation to support your claim?

       I have made contact with the director foreign remittance, John Kelvin and he said that you have only 3 payment options to receive the fund.
The 3 options are;
1.   Bank to Bank transfer .......
2.   Consignment Box/Cash delivery by courier.  It just requires only clearance in the port of entry at your airport but the cost is not confirmed yet.
3.    ATM Visa card which must be activated for international use, in any ATM facility in your country and it shall be delivered to your address in 3 business days/72hrs delivery period.
   Meanwhile, before any further process shall be established on your $2.8 Million, the payment file has to be re-validated due to the over delayed payment process and the re-validation fee is just $50 dollars.

Greetings Dear Unpaid Beneficiary,
This is to inform you that in the course of my investigation as
director of payment verification / implementation committee I came
across your name as unpaid fund beneficiary in the record of the
central bank of Nigeria and other banks that are supposed to get your
funds released to you. My committee was set up by the payment
reconciliation committee to verify and scrutinize all outstanding
debts owed to our foreign beneficiaries in accordance to the
information received from the United States government and other
countries over unpaid huge debts owed to Foreigners.
Having seen your file and my further questioning to the officials of
the central Nigeria bank and ministry of finance as to why your
payment is still pending reveals the rot and corruption in the system.
The bank officials told me that the reason why you haven't received
your payment is due to your inability to pay for the required charges
for transfer of funds to your account. When I asked them why they
didn't deduct the said charges from your principal sum, I was given
the flimsy excuse that you never authorized them to do so. When I put
the question across to them if they ever advised you that such charges
could be deducted from your principal fund,the answer I got was no.
Now, if you do not tell this beneficiary that such charges could be
deducted from his or her principal fund, how will he or she know that
such options are available for such beneficiaries.
From my investigation I discovered that these bank officials
deliberately refused to let the charges be deducted from your
principal fund because they want your fund to remain trapped in the
bank, while they continue to extort money from beneficiaries under
some flimsy excuse. You do not need to pay any money to any official,
all you are required to do is swear an affidavit at the federal high
court of Nigeria, authorizing the bank to deduct all charges from your
principal fund and transfer the balance of funds after deduction to
your bank account. If you have spent any money in the past in your
quest for payment, kindly let me know so that I can follow this up.
You get back to me immediately in my email for a directive on how you
can get the deduction done as soon as possible and get your payment
also.
Yours sincerely,

 Attn: Dear Esteem Beneficiary 
 I received your message and duly noted the contents. Do not panic of 
fear you will receive your overdue funds now without any hitch ok. 
The amount approved to pay you is $15.5m. 
 You see, I am newly appointed as the Chief Justice of Nigeria on 27 June 2022. 
I am assuring you that you will receive your overdue fund 
without any problem by the special grace of the ALMIGHTY GOD, if we 
can work with TRUST ONE MIND AND UNDERSTANDING. 
 As I stated in my first mail, you are not supposed to pay any cent to 
your payee bank because your fund is with the bank. They suppose to 
deduct all charges such as COST OF TRANSFER, TAX, BANK STAMP DUTY, 
COURIER COST etc, from the principal sum and transfer the balance of 
your fund to you after they deducted all the charges. 
 As I advised you in my first message what you need now to do is to swear 
an affidavit at the Federal High Court of Nigeria very important, it 
will authorize the bank to deduct all charges from the principal fund 
and transfer the balance of your fund to you after deduction. 
 My friend, this process will require your present at the Federal High Court 
of Nigeria to swear the affidavit, the ONLY FEE you will pay in person 
at Federal High Court of Nigeria is $50 for the swearing of the 
affidavit but if you cannot come and need an attorney here to help you 
swear the affidavit at the Federal High Court of Nigeria, we have an 
accredited attorney who will help you swear the affidavit at the 
Federal High Court of Nigeria you are not paying him any cent because 
he is working under the Federal High Court of Nigeria. The only fee 
you will pay for the affidavit which is $50 only. 
 NOTE: Once you pay the $50 and the affidavit is sworn the payee 
bank will have the legal right to deduct all the charges as stated 
above and release your fund to you without demanding from you to send 
any upfront payment. 
 If you are pleased to proceed, kindly send to me your full receiving 
bank details if you choose to receive your fund via bank to bank wire 
transfer BUT if you want to receive it via ATM CARD OR CHECK OR CASH MAILING, kindly 
send your receiving address so that it will be forwarded to the 
payee bank. And make sure you send the $50 to enable the 
accredited attorney help you swear an affidavit immediately asap so 
that the payee bank can have the legal right to deduct all the charges 
from the principal fund and release your fund to you. 
 You are advice to try and make sure you send the $50 for the 
affidavit today so that the attorney will go to the 
Federal High Court of Nigeria to swear the affidavit to enable the 
Payee bank have the legal backup to deduct all the charges and release 
your over-due fund to you. 
 NOTE: You're allowed and permitted to ask questions.

Sometimes i do wonder if you are really, really with yourself. How
could you keep trusting people and at the end you will lose your hard
earned money, or are you being deceived by their big names? They
impersonate on many offices, claiming to be Governors,
Directors/Chairmen of one Office or the other.
  Their game plan is only just to extort your hard earned money. Now,
the question is how long will you continue to be deceived? Sometimes,
they will issue you fake check, fake ATM card, introduce you to fake
diplomatic delivery,UN-existing on-line banking and they will also
fake wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order.
  Anyways, by the virtue of my position, I have been following this
transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing the
fund. More often than not, I sit down and look at your ignorance and
that of those who claim they are assisting you; it is very unfortunate
that at the end you lose.
  Although, I don't blame you because you are not here in there  office to
witness the processing of your payment in United States. The problem here is
that you've never been told the whole truth about this transaction and
it is because of this truth they decided to extort you, the keeping
collecting money from you both in here United States and other Countries.
  The most annoying part is even fraudsters have really taken
advantage of this opportunity to enrich themselves at your expense;
those you feel are assisting or working for you are your main
problems.
  I know the truth surrounding this payment and i am the only person
who will deliver you from this long suffering if you will abide by my
advice. Please i beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being
deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this mail so
that i can explain to you the modus-operandi guiding the release of
your Payment. Do not panic or have fear for anything knows you have
gone through hell but time has come to reap.
        Furthermore, all i need from you is trust, just give me the
trust all your information is here with me, because i have work in UN
office for over 8 years both in United States and UK and there is no means of
receiving payment that cost anything except court affidavit of claim
if the owner is not there in person, which will not cost more than $400.
      In addition, all the fees they ask both transfer cost or
delivering cost, clearance certificate known of them exist. If you
really want us to precede please let me know or you ignore my letter
if you are not interested.

According to the email i received from you, i must say thank you very
much, for your high sense of maturity, intelligence, experience and
understanding displayed on your email, although you used the language
of total doubts and uncertainty , your approach and your manner gave
me the impression to reply you immediately.
Furthermore, I am not annoyed or provoked about your comments because
you have a reason for that, Considering the high rate of injustice of
man to man, Insincerity, victimization ,Indiscipline, Violent Crimes,
Political Snugger y, Oppression, scams,  Fear, Insecurity, Corruption
,fraudulent activities e.t.c going around the whole world now, One may
think as you are thinking.
In many lives today, time, money, opportunities, talents, energy,
blessings, properties and spiritual power are being wasted because
many are living a life without a divine purpose. Many are becoming
effective in doing the wrong things, while many are living on
assumption and many are gambling with their divine destiny.
 How do you think that i will be wasting my time writing to you just
because of this God forbid. But I am assuring you that there is no way
this fund relate to a scam. The greatest mountain in life is
conscientious ignorance. Small minds are the first to condemn great
ideas.. I have always known that the kind of people that always fail
in life are people that listen to everybody. Your mind set should
determine your life setting. Success is a product of idea. As an
educated person, you should listen to your conscience to know when you
are dealing with the right person or not.
Do you know that a man's greatness lies in his power of thought?.
Victory will surely go to the one who never quits. All achievements
that you see have their beginning with criticism like this, so do not
listen to hear-say information that you might have received or believe
that everybody is a scam. Most people wish for riches, but few provide
the definite plan and the burning desire which pave the road to
wealth.
My dear, bear in mind that he who looks into the future with the eyes
of fear, will see nothing but failure.  What you hear determines how
you think, how you think determines how you behave and how you behave
determines what you become. Our future is too good to be ignored. Only
fools make permanent decisions without knowledge.
You have my assurance.

From the enquiry from the lawyer on friday, the bank made known to the lawyer that you were suppose pay 1950$ for the processing and transfer of the payment to nominated bank account, but information reaching me here is that you had not completed the payment needed to fastforward the transfer to your account
Sir, in our own view and considering the nature of things all over the world regarding covid19 pandemic and this has stayed longer than necessary, should not be opportuned or incapable of completing the process by making the payment as the bank requires, kindly and conveniently give us the power of attorney to handle everything, so that they hospital can take it upon themselves to complete the process, Just write to bank to delegate to power the St Thomas cancer centre unconditionally to receive the payment and handle the project of mrs Elizabeth Schroeder for the help of Humanity,
Contact the bank to complete the payment in person of mike Spiff via email

 or telephone/whatsapp +234-90-74572676 to complete the process or hand the project to the hospital to complete them, this is my candid advice since you can not carry on with the completion, the hospital management can handle and help alot of cancer patience,

for you to stop this game and do the needful by sending the payment you

I am originally from Norway. My father passed away when I was 21 while my mother passed away in 2009, I have uncles but we are not in a good relationship, I don't know the reason but it all started from my father and I couldn't question him at that moment.
Presently I am 77 years old and I work with American Airlines. It was so shocking and sad that I contacted this deadly virus (COVID-19) which has taken so many lives out of this world.

I have since lost my ability to talk and the doctor has told me that I have only a few weeks to live on this earth. so, I think the best thing to do is to use someone who is trustworthy that will inherit my funds, the reason why I decided to give out my funds is to avoid being taken by the government.

 This is a legitimate transaction of the case of my late client Robert Avtandilyan - ukraine.who was into Oil & Gas deal in ukraine.i contacted you to claim this fund by a legal right given to me. 
 This leaves me no choice but to appoint you as a beneficiary to his founds. As the Residua beneficiary, I have the responsibility to sort out the administrative details I have the authority to decide what happens to this sum as it will be administered in accordance with strict rules and regulations known as ""Rules of Intestacy"". However, I cannot make claim to the inheritance because I am also his lawyer and by the same laws I am prohibited to do so. So,i had to find you otherwise these funds become that of the crown. 
 As a Lawyer (Barrister) I will be representing you in court so you do not need your personal lawyer in this matter because this can only be done here in London. The application is before the court and the probate registry so be rest assured that this is safe. 
 Meanwhile, I expect the sun of the founds goes to business investment for both of you as soon as the funds are released to you. I will come to your country to visit you and also collect my share of the proceed, so please you must be discreet about this matter till the end. 
 I will proceed to the Court this week as soon as I hear from you to commence the processing of the legal documents that will make you the legitimate and bonafide beneficiary of the fund. I will secure all the needed legal documents that will enable you to claim the fund. But before I proceed to the Court, 
 To enable me to file for the legal paperwork that will make you the legitimate beneficiary of the fund. 
 Copy of your identification. Either a driver's license or an International passport copy. 
 As soon as the documents are ready copies will be sent to you to enable you to contact the bank for the remittance of the fund to your nominated bank. 
 Awaiting your response. Find attached a copy of my identification. 
 From your reply to this mail, I will come to a conclusion if I give you a free capacity to handle these fund's so that we can invest them in anything lucrative there in your country.

1049,vi11232.json,Classifier,2023-04-16 12:37:18,"Dear Sir,
Thank you for your message. Sincerely i must tell you the truth
and nothing but the truth about this transaction. With reference to your
previous e-mail received i must bring it to you that this transaction must
be done under legal/legitimate arrangement which is a very important aspect
of this transaction and i must not do anything illegal. This is to avoid
any breach of law and order of both countries. I would not want us to enter
a problem either in my country or in your country so i want us to do this
transaction legally.
This transaction must be kept as a top secret and very confidential from
any third party or a person to avoid double claim or eyebrow. My office and
the accredited attorney must not know my involvement in this transaction to
avoid cancellation of this transfer process.
Honestly before I contacted you, I prayed for God to direct me to you
because there are great opportunities in your country that we can invest
together.
Please do not lose this great opportunity because nothing
good comes easily.I vow to you that i have been monitoring this
account for a long time now and no one has ever come for the claim,
Please do not allow these greedy government politicians to confiscate
this fund into their personal pocket while there are millions of people out there
suffering due to lack of a job. My first priority is to make sure that the
less privileged ones are employed in your country once we invest together
with this fund as soon as the funds hit your account in your country. I
would want us to  have a factory that can produce and accommodate people as
staff of the company in your country.
I have attached an account screenshot and original copy of the deposit
certificate made by our late customer as a proof of the authenticity of this
transaction and for your perusal.
Upon your return of this mail positively i shall guide you with Fund
Transfer Application Form where you will fill out your information for
proceeding of Approval from Bank of England  (BOE) and Final Fund Release
Order (FFRO)  Document in your favor.
God bless you and my regards to your entire family.

I am the UPS head branch secretary general; I received an email alert from our branch in Lagos in regard to your package which has been with them for a long time and the international shipping agent in charge planned to return your package to the federal ministry of finance of Nigeria. The total amount in your ATM CARD is $10.5 million usd and this includes the interest rate up till date. The ATM CARD was programmed to have access globally where you can make withdrawals or transactions in any part of the world.
It seems you don't want to show any seriousness towards the shipment of your package. That's why he wants to return it but he needs permission from me first before he will return the package. I ordered him to stop and I also assured him that I will make sure I talk to you over this before he can then return the package if you show no seriousness. In regard to your ATM CARD package which is worth $10.5 million USD I will help you and make sure you receive it, and my investigation shows you have spent a lot of money recently in regard to this package.
So, my friend, I will be putting up the delivery agent email address for you to contact him immediately and stay in touch with him to deliver the package to you, the delivery agent's name is David Deemer and he's currently in the United States with your package. Sorry we didn't abandon you rather the delivery agent in charge of the delivery of your ATM CARD had an accident late last year so it automatically put a hold on all delivery he had to make, but he's better now and you can email him immediately with his email address; 
daviddeemer323@gmail.com
, to remind him of your ATM CARD in his possession but please remember you will have to do just 2 things when you email him, identify yourself with your full names, telephone number, home address and a photo of you or your ID for proper identification and then you will have to pay his flight ticket down to your place unless you're lucky to be in same state with him, that's all you will take care of and nothing more, nothing less, contact him now.
Have a wonderful day!
Best regards,
Mrs. Patt Joyce butler

1069,wf74315.json,Chat1,2023-04-09 07:14:34,"  Hello,
I felt compelled to get in touch with you and discuss how we might help one another.
My name is Scott Thomson I assumed the role of President of Scotiabank on December 1, 2022 and became President and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank on February 1, 2023. I have been a member of the Scotiabank Board of Directors since 2016.
I firmly feel that God has placed you in my path at this precise moment. You will find this crucial business conversation interesting since you will gain from it, so I want to share it with you.
The estate of a respected client and friend who passed away recently is being administered by me, and it is estimated to be worth $77,000,000.00 (seventy seven million USD).
Although he selected me as executor, knowing full well that I would have the authority to make any choices in the event of a sudden death, there was apparently no mention of an heir or next of kin in any of the estate project agreements with the bank from the outset.
Knowing him for years, the fact that he never married, never had children, never introduced any form of family to me or the bank until his passing left me in a precarious and perplexed situation. The bank management asked the executor to provide instructions last week regarding what to do with the decedent's abandoned estate. As his executor, I am not permitted by law to inherit from, divert from, or claim this estate or any of its assets, but I am permitted to make decisions on whoever I deem to be a reasonably competent and capable claimant.
I contacted you and am now requesting your cooperation to present you for the claim as a trustee because I have been looking for the ideal business-minded individual to share this ideas with and possibly present the individual for the claim. If I am unable to find a deserving individual for the claim, my bank's board of directors will not hesitate to divert the funds to their own selfish uses. Since the transaction will be carried out in accordance with a valid agreement that will safeguard you from any risks, there is no risk involved. Since the bank directors are already wealthy, it is preferable for us to take possession of the funds than to let them do so. I don't have a greedy nature, so I propose splitting the money 50/50 between the two parties. My share will help me to make a difference in the lives of many people who are dying, and I know the asset's owner would be happy if it wasn't mishandled or used for my own gain.
As soon as you let me know what you think about this, I'll reply with more information about the next steps in my response. Please keep this a secret between the two of us only until everything is formally arranged.
Please reply through my private email
ScottThomsonscotiabank@gmail.com
God bless you, and have a goo

Hello Scott,
Thank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your offer and would like to know more about the estate and the process of claiming it. Can you provide more details about the estate and the legal requirements for claiming it? Also, can you clarify how the funds will be split between us? I look forward to hearing back from you.

1070,wf74315.json,Chat1,2023-04-09 21:23:16,"Good to hear from you Linda,
I have received your email and have taken note of all of its contents.
I assume you are knowledgeable, but I must remind you that this proposal is
a legal procedure that is carried out through a probate process. Please do
your own research on the probate process to verify my understanding. I also
want to be clear that in order to make progress on the claim, this process
will require our wholehearted support, time, and some financial investment.
The insurance that prevents you from losing any money on this enterprise
will be handled by my bank. Therefore, I provide you a 100 percent
money-back guarantee; if the high court rejects the probate, every penny
spent on the procedure will be returned in full. For this reason, I
indicated at the outset that the process was risk-free.
So, if you're completely on board, we'll move forward as soon as it's
convenient for you to do so by hiring a probate lawyer, whom I can heartily
suggest.
If you're serious about doing business, kindly let me know so that we may
discuss how we might support one another. When you receive my email, please
remember to reply to it as I will need your full name, address, phone
number, and a copy of your passport.
If you follow my instructions as the executor, I promise this will be a
smooth experience that will change your life.
Here is some more details about me:

being administered by me, and it is estimated to be worth $77,000,000.00
(seventy seven million USD).
Although he selected me as executor, knowing full well that I would have
the authority to make any choices in the event of a sudden death, there was
apparently no mention of an heir or next of kin in any of the estate
project agreements with the bank from the outset.
Knowing him for years, the fact that he never married, never had children,
never introduced any form of family to me or the bank until his passing
left me in a precarious and perplexed situation. The bank management asked
the executor to provide instructions last week regarding what to do with
the decedent's abandoned estate. As his executor, I am not permitted by law
to inherit from, divert from, or claim this estate or any of its assets,
but I am permitted to make decisions on whoever I deem to be a reasonably
competent and capable claimant.
I contacted you and am now requesting your cooperation to present you for
the claim as a trustee because I have been looking for the ideal
business-minded individual to share this ideas with and possibly present
the individual for the claim. If I am unable to find a deserving individual
for the claim, my bank's board of directors will not hesitate to divert the
funds to their own selfish uses. Since the transaction will be carried out
in accordance with a valid agreement that will safeguard you from any
risks, there is no risk involved. Since the bank directors are already
wealthy, it is preferable for us to take possession of the funds than to
let them do so. I don't have a greedy nature, so I propose splitting the
money 50/50 between the two parties. My share will help me to make a
difference in the lives of many people who are dying, and I know the
asset's owner would be happy if it wasn't mishandled or used for my own
gain.
As soon as you let me know what you think about this, I'll reply with more
information about the next steps in my response. Please keep this a secret
between the two of us only until everything is formally arranged.
Please reply
God bless you, and have a good day.

How are you doing?
After waiting to hear from you and your partners for a long time now, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution in order not to let it be as if I have anything in mind  against you. I do not know if you have asked yourself why each time the approval of this fund is released, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped, and one problem or the other  will come up. If you have not asked yourself this question, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.
Some time ago, your partners, I mean the people that introduced you to the business, they approached me through my wife who works with the HM Treasury, a Government's Economic and Finance Ministry and requested me to assist them conclude a money transfer deal they had with you. They asked me to assist them by removing the original contractor's details from the database and replacing it with your details to make you appear as the rightful beneficiary of this fund.
I agreed to do it on condition that they will pay me GBP£80,000.00 as soon as your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as we agreed and demanded to be paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me that you are the one that promised to send money to me, and up till now, I have not received a single cent from them and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude, I decided to  stop the fund release process because I cannot be denied my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my job..  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute any contract or inherit any claim, although I am the only person privileged to know this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude this money transfer deal.
Now I am ready to forget the past, I do not need the GBP£80.000.00 any longer from you but a good compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them are aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money unnecessarily to any of those Officers both here and overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did the work at the beginning and only I can diligently complete the pending funds.
Finally, I need your promise that no official of those Banks you have contacted before will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my compensation will be lodged.
I am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with me, kindly contact me so that we can have a chat over this issue once and for all. But if the reverse is the case, do not bother yourself to reach me and forget about this money.

1106,xj94504.json,Chat1,2023-04-24 18:25:04,"  Greetings,
Please permit me to introduce myself. My Name is Mr. John nkosi   I earn a living in the oil industry as an independent Feasibility/Project Management Consultant to oil refineries and other oil industries in Southern African, East Africa and some parts of Asia. We are based in
Johannesburg RSA. Our mandate includes identifying specific licensed crude oil export/ marketing firms and recommending these firms to the oil refineries for supply of crude oil to the refineries.
On my desk is a mandate from one the refineries to arrange for crude oil purchase from Libya for up to 2,000,000 barrels on monthly bases for 12 calendar months.
The essence of my reaching out to you is the fact that I am in the process of building a middle man structure to mediate between the 2 parties involved before the contract is signed. You may be wondering why I cannot do it by myself right? The honest fact is that as a consultant
to these oil refineries, we are not allowed to act as suppliers of crude oil to them as well, hence the reason I need a trustworthy person outside my work circle in order to maintain a discreet profile.
I wish to extend this partnership to you my friend to build a middle man structure with you, while I work from the back to guide you. Our commission/brokerage as middle persons is between $2 - $3 per barrel as case may be. So if the target of 2M barrels is met monthly we stand to share $4M - $6M every month for a span of 12 months with possible
extension.
Worry less about the speedy sales as I have contacts within oil producing country's top officials for license of crude oil export/lifting to any firm I so present for this business. Therefore if you can be able to handle this transaction with honesty and integrity, you should come back to me immediately for more details. Your urgent response is highly needed and you can reach me on the following email address: 
Mrjohnnkosi000@gmail.com

1107,xj94504.json,Chat1,2023-04-24 18:44:46,"*GREETINGS Mr Henry *
*Thank you for your well received message. Your reply I believe is an
indication that you are willing to be part of this business opportunity,
Also this will not prevent you from doing your normal business as this
project is on the side for making extra income as a legal crude oil license
holder. As long as you are going to be sincere towards this project, we
will have reasons to celebrate in the end. The business is completely legal
and you have nothing to worry about.*
*PLEASE READ THE DETAILS AND GET BACK TO ME*
*You are to become a middleman/sales agent between the buyer and the
National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC). You will be corresponding between
the NOC (seller) and (buyer) electronically from the comfort of your home.
To set the ball rolling in this venture, the first step is for us to apply
for the crude oil export and marketing license from the NOC.*
*There are two ways through which you can apply for the license, one you
can apply in your company name if you have a registered company or you can
apply as an individual in your name. I will draft a license application
letter for you to fill and send to the Licensing operations department of
the NOC to apply for the license. You will type the license application
letter into your official company letterhead paper.*
*(If you want to apply in your company name) and send the application
directly to the licensing operations department of the NOC which is
responsible for issuing crude oil sales licenses. I will direct you step by
step from the process of acquiring the license to become the middleman to
the process of selling your allocated product to the BUYER.*
*The role of a middleman is to locate buyers for the crude oil that will be
allocated to you being a license owner with the NOC and act on behalf of
the NOC in selling the crude to the buyer. This is simply because the NOC
does not deal directly with the buyers of their product but through
approved licensed agents who serve as their sales agents/middleman in their
sales operations.*
*I will link you up with one company which has intentions to buy 2 million
barrels of Libyan crude on monthly bases for 1 year. (So the commissions
are paid out every month throughout the duration of the 12month
contract.)This implies that you will not have problems finding buyers. I
will guide you to apply for the license and also guide you step by step in
all your correspondences between the NOC and the BUYER until the BUYER pays
the NOC for the crude after which your commissions will be calculated and
paid into your nominated receiving bank account.*
*Getting this license will give you the legal authorization of the NOC to
become their sales agent. Please be informed that getting this license is
never a walk in the park because of the prospective nature of the
commissions paid to license owners every month. The licenses are usually
given to the families and relatives of the top government officials as they
did not want people to benefit from such a lucrative venture. But I have
someone in the ministry of oil and gas who will assist us in getting the
license.*
*I will guide you to apply for this license and once you obtain it, the new
doors will open. So I will need you to confirm if you want to apply for the
license in your company name or in your individual name but company name is
preferable.*
*Awaiting your reply to enable us to move towards applying for the license.*
*Regards*
*Mr  John nkosi *

1121,xo18949.json,Chat2,2023-04-16 09:37:48,"Hello Dear
I am confident that this mail gets to you in good health,
My name is barrister James Kwameh  a solicitor to Mrs. Dieziani
Alison-Madueke who was the former Minister of Petroleum from April
2010 – 28 May 2015 Under the Administration of the former President of
Nigeria, Mr. Goodluck Ebele Johnathan.
During her tenure in office, she was able to acquire millions of
dollars through deals done with several multinational oil corporations
using her office as the Minister of Petroleum
A lot of these funds were invested and deposited in several offshore
accounts several in Africa, Europe and Middle East.
Be informed that the funds were deposited in various locations of Europe
One of such investments is the acquisition of Gold mines and bullion
in excess of two hundred and fifty million dollars ($250,000,000.00)
in the Republic of South Africa and Europe,
Another deposit was made in Brussels Belgium with the sum of twenty
Five Million Five hundred thousand US dollars ($25,500,000.00)
While the other deposit was valued at Fifteen   Million Five hundred
thousand US dollars ($15,500,000.00) was deposited with Santander  bank in
London,
I want you to indicate in your own capacity which of the three
deposits you can afford to secure in your custody for investment
pending when you will be required for accountability,
Note that you will be compensated with the 30% of the funds as they
are relocated to your custody, while 5% will be used as compensation
for whatever expenses that might be incurred in the process of
relocating the funds to your custody and 65% will be invested on
behalf of the depositor,
All the documents backing the three deposit are in my custody as her solicitor,
As you can see from the current trend of events and change of
Government in Nigeria, the present administration and wicked enemies
of  my  client is witch-hunting and accusing her of bribery and
corruption. She stands to loose it all if care is not taken.  All that
she has suffered for. I reject it and will not stand by and watch this
happen!
Currently, my hard working client is ill with cancer and battling for
her dear life in a London hospital. As if this is not enough suffering
already, the British National Crime Agency has arrested her for
questioning on these corruption charges.
So read the news below:
Diezani Alison-Madueke arrested in London
I will want you to help me secure my clients s properties (fund) so
that we can invest it in your country under your umbrella,
Diezani Alison-Madueke arrested in London

You will be greatly rewarded. I believe we can do business together...

No More Charges and no more fees of any kind.
Therefore You Have to Pay no dime,UNTIL YOU ARE PAID.
How are you ? I hope you are in Good Health and Body ? My office was
informed that you are no longer alive, but I refused to
believe that statement and decided to hear from the horse's mouth.
Secondly , you will not be asked to pay a dime until you are paid,
that is No Charges whatsoever until you receive your fund.
Thirdly, whatever the case may be , you will not be asked to
contribute any penny from your pocket until your funds are released to
you.
Even if you have to travel to any appointed paying center,there is a
provision to cater and pay for your flight ticket where you are to
receive your payment.
Thus,this arrangement is highly confidential and there will be a need for
you and my office to discuss this matter strictly on phone until you are
paid.
This information is only to a few approved short listed beneficiaries of
which you are among the approved beneficiary hence it is Not more than 3
recipients approved.

Your statement has been noted.
I want you to kindly listen properly and understand what I am talking
about is that you will not pay anything before you get your
payment.
Firstly, i want you to know and understand that your payment will be
finalized without you paying any dime or any single dollars to any
person who claimed to be an official.
Therefore, you will not be asked to pay any money until your fund are
paid to you.
Hence there is a Chief Sponsor who takes care of all expense's and
charges and fees because the moment you are paid you will give him the
5% interest out of the 10.5 Million Part Payment Approved. THUS, No
PAYMENT OFFICER THAT WILL DEMAND ANY SINGLE PENNY FROM YOU.
In view of this , kindly SEND ME YOUR INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT AND YOUR
DIRECT TELEPHONE URGENTLY if you are  REALLY interested to receive
your fund by traveling to the PAYMENT CENTER for the signing of the
FINAL FUND RELEASE AUTHORITY DOCUMENTS.
The earlier you do this the better for the release of your fund,
because in the course of this Traveling  you will not be part of the
expenses such as your TRAVELING TICKET, ACCOMMODATION/RESERVATION AND
YOUR FEEDING WITHIN 3-4 DAYS WILL BE PAID BY THE CHIEF SPONSOR so you
are expected to contribute nothing until you are paid.
That is, you have nothing , i said nothing to contribute until you
receive your payment.
My Direct Phone number is + 44 74 52 33 88 36 for further discussion.
Also  WHAT APP NUMBER :+44 74 52 33 88 36.
This is Just The Little Human contribution to your financial plight.
This arrangement is strictly (only) for beneficiaries who are willing
to travel and finalize their payment by the investors.
Investors are not available for  beneficiaries unable to Travel. As
their case will be reviewed and  re-arranged.
Waiting for the INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT AND YOUR WHATS APP PHONE NUMBER

1138,xu76709.json,Classifier,2023-04-21 15:52:54,"Dear Samuel
Honestly speaking, i want to put you clear about this transaction for
you to understand what i am talking about.
First and foremost , YOU DO NOT PAY ANY MONEY WHAT SO EVER UNTIL YOU
ARE PAID, THAT IS ONCE THE ENDORSEMENT (SIGNING OF THE DOCUMENTS ARE
DONE) YOU PROCEED FOR PAYMENT CENTER. AS SIMPLE AS ANYTHING LIKE
""A.B.C. D "".
Right now , how will the transaction be executed, in the first place,
there is a sponsor (that is an investor ) who intended to use his
resources to finance the transaction and after you are paid then he
will take some percentage averagely 5- 10%.
Therefore, there is an extent he, the CHIEF SPONSOR  will spend hence
there is an agreement he must fulfill such as paying for your flight
ticket to the PAYMENT CENTER
and RETURN TICKET to your country.
Again, he will pay for your hotel reservation and your feeding during
your stay at the PAYMENT CENTER while signing the relevant documents
etc and after you have signed these relevant classified documents you
are to proceed for immediate payment at the assigned or designated
center.
This arrangement is made purely to clear and settle this out standing
debt once and for all
which will prompt the need to empower the recipients with a tangible
GIFT he will hand over to the PAYMENT OFFICERS while proceeding or
going to the assigned or designated center for a positive and
successful release of this payment to the beneficiary.
In other words, this will end up the long associated delay and
nightmare experiences about the un releasing of this payment.
AMOUNT PAYABLE IS $10,500.000.00 USD
Finally, the recipients will ever be grateful for this opportunity.
please for more clarity kindly submit your telephone number with whats
app and i am ready
to expatiate more for your understanding since there is an appointed
chief sponsor that is an investor who is, on a stand by to take care
of any expenses incurred in this transaction and when the funds is
successfully transferred into your account.
Nb: Urgently Bring those information's requested
Yours Respectfully,
Ms Samira Asma

 It is very surprising record was discovered in your payment file that
is why you have not been contacted about this since then. Records
showed that your inheritance payment has been approved four times and
duly completed two times. Also we found out that these funds totaling

resulted in bringing the USA and British Government into the case and

Actually I am 67yrs old of age, and I have been the Chairman of Union Bank

However this Transaction is an Official international fund transfer (OIFT)

As it is now every other beneficiaries have received there own funds and
you are the only beneficiary left to receive your own fund.
As for the Approval documents the exact amount of it is only $2,500, once
you send the fee we need to engage our Bank Lawyer to obtain the approval
documents in your favor, and then we submit it to the Nigerian Government
for immediate approval of your fund, once the approval is done you shall

25 Canada Square, Canary Wharf, London E14 5LB,
Good day
I am Mr. Harvey Terence, Operating Officer and Chartered accountant of
this bank. I am assuring you that with your honest assistance and
joint effort we can complete this life time transaction within 7/14
bank working days.
I need a reliable and honest person who will be able to handle this
opportunity with me because of the need to involve a foreigner. I am
contacting you because of such demand and I believe you will work with
me to achieve this purpose and will never turn down my request.
Before the United States of America and Iraqi war, our bank customer
Mr.Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah, who was the deputy governor of Baghdad in
Iraq and also a business man made a deposit of (GBP10,750,000.00) Ten
Million, Seven Hundred And Fifty Thousand
Pounds Sterling Only in a Bank account number: ABP-LN-685
00/52207712321 over here in our bank.
But I later discovered that the Deputy Governor has been assassinated
in Baghdad by unknown gun men.
Below is the information about his death as a proof and verification
of his assassination In Baghdad:
http: // news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/3970619.stm
During my further investigation after hearing of his assassination in
Baghdad, I also discovered that Mr.Hatem Kamil Abdul Fatah did not
declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper
work of his funds with our bank which might be because he embezzled
this funds while in office and was afraid of revealing his political
dignity when opening the above account number in our bank until his
dead.
My aim of contacting you is to assist me to receive this money in your
bank account over there in your country and let me know how much
commission you will receive out of the total fund when transferred
into your oversea bank account?.
You will diligently transfer the balance to me through another bank
account number from another bank I will forward to you as soon as the
fund is transferred into your over sea account after deducting your
commission from the whole sum or I will come over to your country to
meet with you one on one for sharing of the fund or shall invested the
fund into any lucrative business out there in your country together..
We are going to process and perfect the transaction legally as bank to
bank procedure has been put in place.
I need your urgent reply through my private E-mail address at:
maab1@yahoo.com

I provide more details on how to process the approval of the fund in
your name to be release for instant bank to bank wire transfer into
any designated bank account of your choice without delay.
Please keep this transaction safe and confidential as exposing this
transaction will jeopardize my reputation in this Bank.
I would like to hear from you in no distant time as soon as you read
this mail through the above stated E-mail address so that we can
proceed accordingly.

             I work as a procurement officer for the Singapore Refining
Company Pte Ltd (SRC).
We have recently signed a CRUDE Oil purchase agreement from the NATIONAL
OIL CORPORATION OF LIBYA (NOCL) and urgently need crude oil license agents
from the NOCL.
This is because the NOCL does not sell their CRUDE directly to the buyers
rather, through their approved licensed agents who act as their sales
agent/middleman between them and their buyers.
 Being a license holder guarantees you a monthly commission of not less
than 1 to 3 million dollars monthly if my company utilizes your license for
this monthly crude purchase. I am approaching you to quickly apply to
become a crude oil license holder with the NOCL, I have contacts within the
NOCL who will facilitate your application and make sure it is approved.
Provided you application is approved, and you are licensed, I will make
sure my company SRC utilizes your approved license for their monthly
purchase, and you will receive monthly commission which could be as high 1
to 3 million US dollars,
If you decide to take up this proposition, we can further discuss how we
share the commission between ourselves. I will further guide you on how to
apply for the license from the NOCL.

I would like you to kindly read my email with patience. I am Attorney John Anderson, the legal
assistant to late Engr. (names withheld) hereinafter referred to as 'My Client', a citizen of your
country who
died a few years ago. I got your contact details after an exhaustive search online for my client's
relatives in order to retrieve the US$10, 500,000.00 (Ten Million, Five Hundred thousand
United States Dollars) that he deposited in a South African bank , before his untimely death.
I approach you on a personal conviction of trust, to partner with me in receiving the money. As
his attorney, I have all key documents relating to the deposit and his death. The Bank has asked
me to present to his relatives to claim the funds within 30 days or forfeit it permanently in line
with the laws of the republic of South Africa.
My wish is for this money to be invested in your country in areas that will create jobs and be of
benefit to ordinary citizens. By this letter, I request your consent to present you to the Bank as a
close relation of my client, so that the funds can be transferred directly to you. Once you receive
the funds, you will keep 45% for yourself and 45% will be transferred to me. I will invest my
share in a profitable venture in your country using your guidance. The remaining 10% will be for
any charity organization of your choice in your country.
This claim is straightforward and will be carried out under proper directives that will protect you
from breaking any laws. I kindly request you to keep the details of my proposal confidential
because of its nature for total success.
Further information about the process and documents will be provided to you upon your reply.

This is very urgent because banking rules and regulations state that any money that remains unclaimed for a long period of time will be transferred to the Federal Reserve account as unclaimed money. Therefore, if you are really interested in this transaction, then write back to me as soon as possible to send you an application which you will fill out and submit to our bank administration to process the transfer of (USD 4.2 million) in your name to your bank account with immediate effect.

Thank you for your mail and the content well noted. You have nothing to
worry about because I have a lawyer that""s going to handle everything.
The war is devastating to me because I just lost my mother and my father so
it has been a very painful experience.
Kindly be well informed that the fund was dispatched to POLAND through  an
AMERICAN DIPLOMATIC ENVOY so the fund has been deposited in a security
financial firm in Poland  and all I need is just an investor and friend who
will act as the beneficiary of the fund because every fund coming from my
country is been monitored and seized because of the invasion so I need a
trusted person who will in turn be the investor and honestly the person
will get 40% of the total sum of $10M for his/her help while I will get the
balance of the fund.
All you need to do now is kindly send me your full name and address, Direct
telephone number, occupation/position and any form of identification so
that I can send to the lawyer to prepare all legal documents that will
enable you make claim to the fund as the legal beneficiary and the fund
will be tagged as an investment fund so that after you have received it
then I can be coming to meet you and share it so that the remaining one
after you have collected your own share will be used for investment and you
will also manage the investment since you know your country and know what
to invest into.
As soon as your personal details are received and the documents prepared by
the lawyer through the law court the contact of the security financial firm
will be given to you to contact them and receive the fund without any delay
or questioning and this is  no problem whatsoever.
The certificate of deposit that confirms when the deposit was made is with
me and it will be sent to you soonest I hear from you so that we can
proceed.
All I need is honesty,commitment,love and above all togetherness so that we
do not fail to accomplish this good, great desire.
You will even help me to come over with my only son.
I am waiting to hear from you very soon because I am sad and cry daily
because all I laboured in my country is destroyed so I need peace and a new
country to settle down and stop the pains and tears that the RUSSIANS
brought upon my country.
Please help me because I am devastated and I need help now.
