        "body": "  My Dear Beloved Friend,\nSorry for contacting you through this medium, however i do not have any other choice as I am a patient in dare need. I am Mrs Margret Dennis from London and am aged 68 years suffering from endometrial cancer. Please, I want you to help me create a charitable project with the money that I inherited from my deceased husband who died in a motor accident.\n I was brought up from a motherless baby's home and was married to my late husband for twenty nine years without a child, my friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness and I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them anymore, so I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of Â£9,000,000 GBP (Nine Million Pounds) with my bank.\nAll I need is an honest person who will use at least % 70 of the funds as I would instruct, then the rest % 30 will go to you for helping me accomplish this mission because donating this money to charity is the only legacy I can leave behind after my death, No money is required from you to carry on with this project because it is my heart desire to make a generous gift to you to work for a charity in your country.\nI don't mind if you are a Christian or Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist rather my only paramount concern here is whether I can trust you because this generation is filled up with greedy and fraudulent people all over the world. I will give you more details as soon as I hear from you.\nLooking forward to your urgent response, on my private Email:  \nMagretdennis12@hotmail.com\nKind regards.\nMrs Margret Dennis   "

I'm sure it will make a significant difference in many lives.\n\nI understand that I need to get in touch with Mr. Paul Smith, the attorney who has been handling the deposition of this fund. It's great to know that he is well-informed about our communication and is expecting my contact.\n\nHowever, before proceeding further, could you please provide me with more details about the process? For instance, what kind of information will Mr. Smith require from me? And how long does it usually take for such a transfer to be completed?\n\nAlso, could you kindly clarify what you meant by \"all related to the deposit is with my lawyer\"? Does this mean all documents and legal paperwork are currently with him?\n\nI appreciate your guidance on this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nScott"
