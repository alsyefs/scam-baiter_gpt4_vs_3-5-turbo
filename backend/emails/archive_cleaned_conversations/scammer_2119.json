It's not every day that one gets a chance to be part of such an intriguing business proposal.\n\nYour role as a broker in Uganda sounds fascinating, and I can imagine it must be quite rewarding to provide funding and investment opportunities for top government officials in East Africa. The idea of diversifying their investments overseas is indeed a wise strategy.\n\nThe concept of managing funds under my company's control and management for a term of years sounds like an interesting challenge. However, I would need more information about this role. Could you please elaborate on what exactly this entails? What kind of responsibilities would I have?\n\nYou mentioned a Draft Investment Contract Agreement (MOU) that will be made available by the Investor Lawyer at a later stage. Could you give me an idea of when this might happen? Also, could you provide some details about the target sector we would be investing in?\n\nI'm eager to learn more about this opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDeborah"
