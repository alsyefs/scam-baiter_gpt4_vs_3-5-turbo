Just \r\nlet me know if you are in, then I can let you know the process we need \r\nto take. My company will give you a supply contract agreement for 3yrs, \r\nbut I do not want my company to know that Iâ€™m behind this, but as an \r\ninsider and your silent partner, I will do everything possible for you \r\nto get the contract. and once the contract is signed, we are good to \r\ncommence your monthly bulk supply which is 85-100 barrels  monthly and \r\n2000-3000 yearly\r\n\r\nRemember that my company may require samples of 2 barrels prior to \r\ncontract for confirmatory test analysis, which we will provide to them, \r\nbut that will be after you get in touch with the Chief Procurement \r\nofficer and also I will introduce you to the producer. What we need to \r\ndo is to sign an MOU binding our profit sharing of 80/20 you keep 80% \r\nthen I keep 20%  If you are ok with the profit sharing and also want us \r\nto continue, please send me your full name, company name if any and full \r\naddress to enable me draft an MOU that is going to bind our profit \r\nsharing.

        "body": "Hello Martin,\n\nThank you for reaching out and explaining the supply contract bid with your company. The Herbal Solution product sounds interesting. I'm intrigued by the business opportunity you're presenting, especially since it involves a producer in Turkey.\n\nI understand that there's a profit to be made from selling per barrel to your company. However, I would like to know more about the process we need to take if I decide to join this venture.\n\nYou mentioned an MOU binding our profit sharing. Could you please elaborate on what this entails? Also, how does the sample requirement of barrels work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about this opportunity.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"

The payment policy is 60% T/T prior to \r\ndelivery of your bulk aupply and on delivery you will have 40% balance. \r\nThat will be after the confirmatory analytical result of 2 barrels \r\nsamples which will be tested at our company's laboratory by the \r\nTechnicians but supervised by me as the production manager.\r\n\r\n  After we sign MOU, i will draft an introduction letter for you that you \r\nwill be sending to my company via the Chief procurement officer(CPO), \r\nyou will be asked to send the product specification of the raw material. \r\nThen i will give you the contact of the producer in Turkey who will send \r\nit to you and he was the one producing for my late supplier for  6 years \r\nbefore his demise during the covid-19 . After verification of the \r\nproduct spec you will also be asked to supply 2 barrels of the raw \r\nmaterial which will be sample, its to ascertain a confirmatory test \r\nresult at our company laboratory which will be conducted under my watch. \r\nAfter the test, you will be given 3 years contract, 60% upfront payment \r\nto commence on your monthly bulk supply and the monthly demand is from \r\n85-200 barrels and finally the payment for the 2 barrels initially \r\nsupplied for sample.\r\n\r\nThe producer has all the certification to ship to any destination of \r\nyour choice. Like  i said before he ships with his certification but \r\nwith your name and full contact address on the bill of laden and on the \r\nbarrels too so my company knows its coming from you. You will be the one \r\nto give the producer the receiver's information. He will also give you \r\nthe pictures of the produced raw material in barrels and tracking \r\nnumbers from the forwarders, this is to ascertain the movement of the \r\nproduct and the arrival which takes just 3 days to UK. Send your name in \r\nfull, company name if any and contact address for the drafting of MOU.\r\n\nMartin Klonz."

The producer will sell to you at $9000 per barrel while my \r\ncompany buys at $22,400 per barrel. My job as your insider and your \r\nsilent partner is to ensure that your company wins the bid. I cant move \r\nahead with you without signing MOU, its the only agreement i have with \r\nyou and its going to bind my 20% commission.
