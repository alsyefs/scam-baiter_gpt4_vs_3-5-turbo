        "body": "Dear Mr. Alfonso,\r\n\r\nI appreciate your swift response and your interest in my situation. Let me\r\nprovide more details about the Camp Red Cloud Army Base, where I am\r\ncurrently stationed in South Korea. This base, operated by the United\r\nStates, is situated near Uijeongbu, forming the largest part of the Red\r\nCloud Garrison. Positioned close to the DMZ, its primary goal is to\r\nmaintain peace in the region, under the management of the US Army. Although\r\nits history is not extensive, it holds strategic significance.\r\n\r\nRegarding my previous message, severe rains led to devastating flooding in\r\nSouth Korea, resulting in the loss of lives, homes, and businesses,\r\nparticularly affecting wealthy individuals and politicians. During a\r\nroutine patrol, I discovered a hidden box containing $15 million in a\r\ndemolished building. Suspecting it belonged to corrupt politicians, I kept\r\nit confidential. Now, with my active duty, I seek a trustworthy person to\r\nsecure the funds until my return from Uijeongbu.\r\n\r\nI apologize for intruding into your privacy but found your profile in the\r\nDOD database, prompting me to seek your assistance. My late wife, Deborah\r\nWilson, would have handled this, but her tragic demise in the 9/11 attacks\r\nled me to join the US Army. I am determined to combat terrorism and aspire\r\nto a peaceful retirement. Trust is paramount; upon transfer, I suggest a\r\n40-50-10 split, with you keeping 40%, 50% for me, and 10% donated to\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nCan I trust you with this responsibility? What is your occupation, and are\r\nyou married with children? The discreet transfer of funds is crucial, and I\r\nemphasize the need for confidentiality. If you are willing and capable,\r\nplease confirm your commitment, and we can proceed with the necessary\r\narrangements through email.\r\n\r\nThank you once again, and may God bless you. Kindly acknowledge the receipt\r\nof this message.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nSgt. Wilson"
