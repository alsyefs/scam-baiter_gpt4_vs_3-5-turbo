Can you tell me more about it? What were some of the topics discussed during the meeting?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about how these funds will be packaged in two boxes. Could you explain more about this process? \n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but I'm just so excited and want to understand everything clearly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S: I hope you understand that for security reasons, I won't be able to share my personal details over email.\n\nBest wishes,\nMadeline"
