        "body": "Hello Mr. Burns,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding this package and the items inside. I must say, I am quite surprised by the news of my supposed demise in a car accident. Rest assured, I am very much alive and well.\n\nI find it concerning that someone named Mr. Mark Edward has approached you claiming to be my next of kin and wanting to pay for the delivery of the package with an iTunes gift card. That seems rather unusual, don't you think?\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about this situation? How did Mr. Edward come to know about this package and why would he need an iTunes gift card for its delivery? I want to make sure everything is legitimate before proceeding any further.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nGoldie"
