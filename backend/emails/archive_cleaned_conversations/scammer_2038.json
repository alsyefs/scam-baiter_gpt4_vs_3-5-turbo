        "body": "Dear Tania,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response on the Investment Proposal. I will be happy to\r\nassist you with more information and give you a broad-view of the proposal\r\nfor a better understanding about the partnership. I also apologize for my\r\ndelayed response and any inconvenience it may have caused you.\r\n\r\nAbout £122,800,000 was incurred from unclaimed shares running from 2000 -\r\n2021 during my time as the fund manager at M&G plc, London. These funds are\r\nowned by deceased clients which are subsequently bought either by the\r\ncompany or each of the company shareholders as provided by the company\r\narticles. Not too long, part of the shares that worth £68,800,000 was sold\r\nby the company to fund a new initiative which was bought by a friend\r\ninvestor but seemingly falls to £47,800,000 in the span of 2 years after\r\nadjusting to inflation. Due to the frustration of the drastic fall of the\r\nshares, it was sold to an American investor for cash with the aim of\r\ninvesting outside the stock market before he was struck by a stroke.\r\n\r\nDue to the reason above, I have been given the mandate to handle and\r\nmonitor the affairs of the investment because of the trust he has in me.\r\nTherefore, seeking a trusted partnership for an investment outside of the\r\nstock house where we can invest in some of these businesses like; Oil/Gas\r\nplants, Farming/Agriculture, Healthcare, Transportation or a business like\r\nReal estate, whichever that is suitable for the portfolio manager just like\r\nI mentioned earlier.\r\n\r\nTo clarify you further, your incredible ideas, management capability and\r\nuprightness is only what will be essential in this partnership. In\r\nagreement for partnership, you will get 5% for receiving the money in your\r\ncountry, 2.5% for setting up a good investment environment and 30% of any\r\ninvestment return from the partnership.\r\n\r\nIf you are upright and interested in partnering with us, kindly send us\r\nyour executive summary/business plan for investment review. while a legal\r\npractitioner will draft the necessary documents to be signed and it is\r\noptional but we may sign a Non-Disclosure agreement for your protection\r\nthrough the transaction.\r\n\r\nLastly, if you are in search of funding support, or instruments to enhance\r\nfinancial transactions or in need of funding of existing business (Credible\r\nProjects) requiring expansion like listed above, we can also provide an\r\nimmediate solution in the form of direct loan at a low interest rate of\r\n2.10% to 3.10% per annum. Your quick response to indicate your kin\r\ninterests would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nDo reach out if you have any more questions. Thank you for your time and\r\nattention to this matter and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\r\n\nYour Sincerely ,\r\nOtto J. Donner\r\nAssociate Director"

        "body": "Hello Tania,\r\n\r\nI am writing to confirm the receipt of your email and I apologize for the\r\ndelayed response.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question,  corporation articles are the provisions which\r\ngovern the rights of shareholders and representatives of a company.\r\nAccordingly these articles contain rights which will allow directors to\r\nrefuse the registration of the transfer or pre-emption rights may apply\r\nwhereby the deceased’s shares need to be offered to the existing\r\nshareholders which may not be accounted for in the deceased’s Will. The\r\narticles may also restrict the personal representative right to be\r\nregistered as a shareholder or generally to transfer legal title of the\r\nshares from the deceased to the beneficiaries named in the\r\nWill. Pre-emption rights are an effective way to protect the interests of\r\nthe remaining shareholders, enabling them to maintain their proportion of\r\nownership and control.  If the shareholders decline to buy the available\r\nshares they can be offered to third party purchasers including family\r\nmembers of the deceased and etcetera.\r\n\r\nRegarding the reason why we decided to invest outside of the stock market,\r\nthe approximately seventy (70%) drop in value of the shares over a two year\r\nperiod is remarkable enough to leave the stock market and invest in more\r\nphysical projects. I believe you'd agree with me on that.\r\n\r\nLast and not the least, your role will be to identify areas where a huge\r\ncapacity of investment return will be actualized and also to create a\r\nsustainable and convenient investment environment and have direct contact\r\nwith the principal investor.\r\n\r\nLastly, We grant the most flexible loan at the lowest interest rate with no\r\nsecurities needed before approval of the loan. You only need to keep to\r\nyour promise of repayment to stand a chance for a higher loan.\r\n\r\nI hope this information is enough to give you a better understanding of our\r\nproposal. If you are interested in the partnership, kindly tell us your\r\nbusiness idea or you could send us your executive summary/business plan for\r\ninvestment review.\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience and understanding as I look forward to hearing\r\nfrom you.\nRegards,\r\nOtto J. Donner"
