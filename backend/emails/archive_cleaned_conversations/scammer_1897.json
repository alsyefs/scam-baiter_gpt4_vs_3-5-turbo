        "body": "Dear Mrs. Vera Uzo,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing this information. I must admit, it sounds quite concerning that there have been issues with funds in the banking sector. Can you please explain to me in more detail how these bank directors were able to move funds overseas without leaving a trace? It seems like a serious breach of trust.\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the role of the presidency and Senate in this matter. How exactly did your office become mandated by them, and what actions have been taken so far to address this issue?\n\nRegarding my personal information, I understand that you need certain details from me. However, I would feel more comfortable if you could clarify why my name and account were deleted by the fired bank directors. How did they gain access to my information in the first place?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nNorman"

        "body": "Dear Mrs. Vera Uzo,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope this message finds you well. I appreciate your efforts in providing me with the necessary information regarding the legal process and the involvement of Barrister Adeola Rahman as the lawyer for processing the legal papers.\n\nI understand that it is important to clear the legality of the fund, and I am glad that steps are being taken to ensure everything is done properly. However, I have a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1. Could you please explain in more detail what exactly the Affidavit of Oath entails and how it will help clear the legality of the fund?\n\n2. You mentioned that other documents will be issued to me from the authority concerned, particularly regarding Senate fund approval and fund origin. Can you provide more information about these documents and their significance?\n\nRegarding taxes, I do pay taxes to my government as required by law. However, I would like to know how much taxes would be applicable if I were to receive such a substantial amount of funds.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance in clarifying these matters. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nNorman"

However, I'm curious to know if there are any other fees or charges that need to be paid in order to facilitate the transfer of funds? Could you please clarify this for me?\n\nI apologize if my questions seem repetitive, but I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of the process before proceeding further.
