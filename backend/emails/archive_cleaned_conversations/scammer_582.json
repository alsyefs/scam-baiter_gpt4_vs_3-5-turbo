I am 68 years old and I have\r\nbeen suffering from Pancreatic Exocrine Cancer for the past 3 years. I was\r\ntold by my doctor that my health condition has worsened with need to embark\r\non a surgical operation at Johns Hopkins Health Baltimore Maryland, USA.\r\nBut my doctor has advised me not to undergo the surgical operation because\r\nmy chances of survival is very slim and this has left me in a state of\r\ndespair. Worst is, I don't have a child of my own due to my Catholic faith\r\nwhich did not permit me to marry.\r\n\r\nDue to my dying condition, I have promised God that I will spend all my\r\nlife savings and inheritance on the less privileged and this is where I\r\nwill be needing your help. I am willing to will all my fund to you which is\r\nabout $6,150,000.00 ( Six Million, One Hundred and Fifty Thousand US\r\nDollars). You will be permitted to take 45% of the fund for your family and\r\npersonal use. The remaining 55% will be strictly for charity. I wish that\r\nyou set up a foundation in your country under my name to serve as my\r\nmemorial when I'm gone.\r\n\r\nThis cash is deposited in a secured bank in the Philippines and I have\r\ninformed my lawyer appropriately about my decision to Will this fund to\r\nyou.  Kindly get back to me immediately with the information below through\r\nmy private email (revmyleenduterte@gmail.com) if you are interested in\r\ncarrying out this task on my behalf:\r\n\r\n\r\nYour full name...........\r\nYour mobile number............\r\nYour age.......................\r\nYour sex...........................\r\nYour identification proof....................\r\nYour occupation.................... ...........\r\nYour country and city.......................\r\n\r\n\r\nNB: I will appreciate your confidentiality and trust in a bid to accomplish\r\nmy heart's desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last\r\nwish.\r\n\r\nGod bless you.\r\nReverend Sister Myleen Duterte"
