And what exactly is the role of the FBI and UN Nigeria in this situation?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"awarded this funds\"? Is there a specific amount that has been allocated to me? \n\nI understand that The Federal Reserve Bank will be handling the transfer of these funds. However, I'm not sure what you mean by \"clearance\". Could you elaborate on that?\n\nLastly, I appreciate your request for my personal details, but due to privacy concerns, I prefer not to share them over email. Is there another secure method we can use for this process?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAshley"

The FBI conducted a massive investigation after the report from the\r\nUnited Nations office in Nigeria regarding victims of scam. Here your name\r\nwas involved among other victims and so recommendations were made which\r\nincludes you for compensation. And so you were awarded a compensation fund\r\nin the amount of $1,500,000. Yes, the UN Nigeria is responsible for the\r\nverification and release of your clearance authorization to the Federal\r\nReserve Bank of New York, who in turn will complete your transaction by\r\nwire transfer. We need only your full name, cell phone no. and your bank\r\naccount to get it done. This method of processing  has been secured.\r\n\r\n Best regards.\r\n\r\n Eric W. Holmes.\r\n U.N.New York."
