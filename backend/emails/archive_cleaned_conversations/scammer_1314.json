        "body": "Hello Ms. Kristalina Georgieva,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite a surprise to hear about this fund, I must admit I wasn't aware of it until now. \n\nI'm glad to hear that my government embassy has been involved and has paid for the fund. That's very reassuring! \n\nYou mentioned that the only fee I have to pay is to obtain my fund release order from the supreme court. Could you please explain more about this process? How much is the fee and how do I go about paying it?\n\nAlso, you mentioned two options for receiving the fund - through check or Bank to Bank Wire Transfer. Could you provide more details on these options? Which one would be faster and more secure?\n\nLastly, you asked me to buy a Steam wallet card or Sephora card and attach a picture of it. Could you clarify why this is necessary? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
