        "body": "Attn: Rebecca,\r\n\r\nMy name is Yemi Cardoso.  I am the new  governor of Central Bank of\r\nNigeria.  While going through beneficiaries'/contractors' files\r\nyesterday, I came across your own file and discovered that the major\r\nreason why you have not received your fund for the past years is\r\nbecause you are not the real contractor who executed this contract.\r\nAnd if you continue to fight to receive this fund it will be\r\nimpossible for you to get it.\r\n\r\nBased on that fact, I want you and I to strike a deal so that if you\r\nare ready to receive the fund, I will guide you on the necessary\r\nthings to be done so that you will receive this fund.  If you keep\r\ntrying on your own to claim this fund they will need you to get the\r\nvital documents from the original contractor that backs up this fund.\r\nBut I want to make it much easier for you if you can accept to work\r\nwith me so that I will make it possible for you to receive this fund.\r\n\r\nThe total amount in question is USD$26.5M.  So if you are ready to\r\nwork with me, I need you to provide your full information to me such\r\nas your full names, address, phone and any of your identification\r\ncard.  On receipt of those information from you, I will tell you the\r\nnext step.\r\n\r\nPlease you should be informed that I will provide all the necessary\r\ndocuments that will back up this fund so that after you receive this\r\nfund there will be no agency that will question you about the source\r\nof this fund.  I also want to ask you if you can be able to come down\r\nhere to sign all those documents.  But if you know you cannot be able\r\nto come down here to sign the documents, a competent lawyer here will\r\nsign  those documents on your behalf and the lawyer will charge the\r\nsum of $350 for him to sign those documents for you which you will be\r\nthe person to pay this fee because you will be required to send a copy\r\nof the receipt of payment of this $350.  That is the only fee you will\r\npay and nothing again to pay before you receive this fund.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this is a deal between you and I and I want you to\r\ncooperate with me.\r\n\r\nPlease you should reply this to this email address: cardosoyemi6@gmail.com\r\n\nYou can also call me on the phone number: +234-9165637153.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nYemi Cardoso\r\nNew Central Bank Governor.\r\n\r\nE-mail: cardosoyemi6@gmail.com"

While going through beneficiaries'/contractors' files\nyesterday, I came across your own file and discovered that the major\nreason why you have not received your fund for the past years is\nbecause you are not the real contractor who executed this contract.\nAnd if you continue to fight to receive this fund it will be\nimpossible for you to get it.\nBased on that fact, I want you and I to strike a deal so that if you\nare ready to receive the fund, I will guide you on the necessary\nthings to be done so that you will receive this fund.  If you keep\ntrying on your own to claim this fund they will need you to get the\nvital documents from the original contractor that backs up this fund.\nBut I want to make it much easier for you if you can accept to work\nwith me so that I will make it possible for you to receive this fund.\nThe total amount in question is USD$26.5M.  So if you are ready to\nwork with me, I need you to provide your full information to me such\nas your full names, address, phone and any of your identification\ncard.  On receipt of those information from you, I will tell you the\nnext step.\na\nPlease you should be informed that I will provide all the necessary\ndocuments that will back up this fund so that after you receive this\nfund there will be no agency that will question you about the source\nof this fund.  I also want to ask you if you can be able to come down\nhere to sign all those documents.  But if you know you cannot be able\nto come down here to sign the documents, a competent lawyer here will\nsign  those documents on your behalf and the lawyer will charge the\nsum of $350 for him to sign those documents for you which you will be\nthe person to pay this fee because you will be required to send a copy\nof the receipt of payment of this $350.  That is the only fee you will\npay and nothing again to pay before you receive this fund.\nPlease note that this is a deal between you and I and I want you to\ncooperate with me.\nPlease you should reply this to this email address: \ncardosoyemi6@gmail.com\nYou can also call me on the phone number: +234-9165637153.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nYemi Cardoso\nNew Central Bank Governor.\nE-mail: \ncardosoyemi6@gmail.com\n "
