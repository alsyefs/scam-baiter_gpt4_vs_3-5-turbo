        "body": "Dear Ruth,\r\n\r\nThank you for your email towards my business proposal. First, let me introduce myself properly so you can understand better. I am a 51 year old widow from South Africa and former employee of the South African shipping industry, currently in Ghana for safety after my husband was brutally murdered. My late husband, James Lumubia, was a retired politician. He is a senior director of the civil society group and also a human rights activist. He was murdered by a secret government assassin for constantly criticizing the government for its bad policies, mistreatment, and murders of innocent citizens.\r\n\r\nAfter his untimely death, I managed to escape to a remote village far from the city, because the same killers are looking for me and my only daughter Olivia. I am still shocked by the horrendous murder of my husband because I cannot believe that he was killed by the same people with whom he spent most of his active days in government many years ago before he retired.\r\n\r\nThey even confiscated my late husband's property and bank accounts. It has become so difficult for my daughter and I that we cannot walk around the neighborhood without being noticed, because we are afraid of being killed. While I was in the camp, I contacted an NGO to move out of South Africa because our lives are no longer safe in our country. We are wanted in every way possible by the government and its hired killers. We finally managed to escape to Ghana, fortunately with the help of NGOs.\r\n\r\nBefore his untimely death, we agreed to invest the funds in real estate. I am currently considering investing these funds to purchase properties, i.e. investing in real estate as originally agreed with my late husband, so I am contacting you to assist me in investing the funds on my behalf as the investment manager of money. I would like you to know that in addition to real estate, you can advise me on other areas in which we can invest. Please note that the investment conditions are as follows: 80% for investments, 15% for the fund manager and 5% for expenses.\r\n\r\nI need a trustworthy person to help me with this project since I am a widow and do not have much knowledge to handle this on my own. I pray that my daughter and I will one day overcome this trauma. Once we conclude our discussion, we will sign a Memorandum of Understanding specifying the investment teams.\r\n\r\nI await your response so we can move forward.\nBest Regards,\r\nHannah Lumubia"
