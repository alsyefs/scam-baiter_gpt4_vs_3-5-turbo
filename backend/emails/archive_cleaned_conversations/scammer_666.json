One of the agendas of the meeting had to do with payment of all over-due/outstanding  to foreign contractors/inheritors of all their funds which the past directors delayed the payments as a result of their selfish aims.\n Our board of directors have empowered me through the order of the Presidency to contact you so that you can receive your over-due fund three million,five hundred thousand dollars ($3,500,000.00) which is still with our bank without any further stress.  So if you are ready and interested in receiving this fund, please kindly respond to this email so that I will guide you on a few requirements that you need to meet in order to receive this fund.\n Note: Please if you are not interested in receiving this funds, kindly send us a signed document requesting us to divert all your funds to children of the orphanage (Charity)\n   Thanking you while awaiting your swift response so we can serve you better.\nBest Regards.\nMaria Aduhail\nDirector, Foreign Remittance Dept.\nBanco de espana   "
