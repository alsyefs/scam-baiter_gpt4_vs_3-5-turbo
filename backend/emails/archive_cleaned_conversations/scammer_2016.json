Monarch Investment\r\ngroup, of which I am a director, got a contract project of about\r\nUS$103Million from the Cambodian government in collaboration with a German\r\ncompany Veritas Oil and Gas company to develop part of KOK TANG PREAH\r\nSIHANOUK PROVINCE. All arrangements were up and awaiting payment when our\r\nGerman friend and collaborator suddenly died.\r\n\r\nVeritas Oil and Gas company a foreign company owned by Mr. Herbert Karven,\r\nacted as an expert consultant to Monarch Investment Company in this\r\nproject. The understanding was an indirect way of moving funds out of\r\nCambodia for foreign investment.\r\n\r\nAfter Herbert Karven's death and having had our payment delayed, we are\r\nleft with no option than to carry on the arrangement as previously planned\r\nby the group but with a change of foreign representative, hence my contact\r\nto you. We solicit for you to take over as the expatriate company that\r\nMonarch Investment Group consulted in order to have the part payment of USD\r\n$29,867,525 (Twenty Nine Million Eight Hundred and Sixty Seven thousand,\r\nFive Hundred and Twenty Five Cents) released to us by the Cambodia\r\ngovernment. You will take 30% from this payment while keeping 70% will be\r\nfor us until when needed for our investment purposes in your care. We will\r\nattach the project plan and our contract agreement with the Cambodian\r\ngovernment for you to go through and understand more of this collaboration\r\nafter I hear from you.\r\n\r\nWe are anticipating a yes response from you on this collaboration. With the\r\ninfluence of my other company executive and royal partner and friend, Son\r\nAltesse Sisowath Panara Sirivuth the cousin of the current King of\r\nCambodia, everything will go as arranged without any hindrance.\r\nDo get back urgently to me to tell you how we can go about this as the\r\nMinistry of Economy and Finance is awaiting payment instructions from\r\nMonarch Investment Company. My personal regards as I await your reply. I\r\nhave attached our IDs which includes my diplomatic passport and photos of\r\nthe people involved and hope that you can keep this transaction a top\r\nsecret.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nOknha Ung Phallar\r\nTell/WhatsApp +855-88-507 7039\r\nEmail: uphallar@monarchinvestment-kh.asia\r\n\r\nNote: Okhna: is a title honor given to outstanding Cambodia Citizens of\r\nrespect by the Monarchy.\r\nSon Altesse: is the title of members of the King's family.\r\n_______"
