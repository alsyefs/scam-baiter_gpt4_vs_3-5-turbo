        "body": "  Hello,\nBased on a series of petitions we received from various organizations such as Corporate Bodies and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) on the Inability of some Government officials, Commercial banks and World Lottery Organization to settle their clients Contract debt, Inheritance and Winning Prizes. We have been authorized by the Debt Reconciliation Unit of this institution (United Nations), to investigate the unnecessary delay on the payment approved in your favor. During the course of our investigation, we discovered with dismay that your payment has been unnecessarily delayed by corrupt officials of the Bank who are trying to divert your funds into their personal accounts.\nAs you are well aware many foreigners have invested thousands of United States Dollars into Nigeria and in many parts of the world transactions in Hopeless Dreams to have none of them become a reality. Your file is one of the approved legitimate beneficiaries to receive a grant of US$150,000.00 (One Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) Only, as directed by the United Nations Secretary General Mr. Antonio Guterres, We have agreed with the African, European, Asian and American Government that US$150,000.00 (One Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) Only would be paid to you as grant Via special arrangement as first installment. This is to enable you to have enough funds to pay for the Tax Clearance and bank charges before you will receive the balance of your funds.\nYour immediate reply with your correct and valid details is highly needed to avoid cancellation of your grant.\nRegards,\nMr. Patrick David Kanja.   "
