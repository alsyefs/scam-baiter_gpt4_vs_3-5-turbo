        "body": "Hello Mr. Georges Elhedery,\n\nThank you for your email and the detailed information provided. It's quite a surprise to hear about this fund that belongs to me, I wasn't aware of it until now.\n\nI'm glad to hear that HSBC Bank is taking such good care of my interests and has even arrested someone who was trying to change the status of my approved fund. That's very reassuring!\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please explain how this fund came into existence? And why was I not informed about it earlier?\n\nAlso, I noticed that you've asked for some personal details including bank information and a scanned copy of my driver's license or National ID Card. While I understand the need for verification, I'm a bit hesitant to share such sensitive information over email due to security reasons.\n\nCould we perhaps arrange a meeting at one of your branches where I can provide these details in person? Or maybe there's another secure way you usually handle this kind of situation?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPablo"
