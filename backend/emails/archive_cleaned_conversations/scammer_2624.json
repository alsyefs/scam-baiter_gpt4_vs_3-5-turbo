        "body": "Dear Gerardo,\r\n\r\nSir,\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear your questions on the over invoicing transaction of\r\nusd$85M receipt.\r\n\r\n1. Third-Party Indemnity Bond, is the legal frame work connecting the proxy\r\nclaimant, of the over-invoice, and the original contract awarded person.\r\n\r\nWho does that, is the judiciary,  that created the legal framework. Take\r\nnote of this angle called Third Party Indemnity Bond, which gives you\r\npermission to claim the over invoice legally, channel it in investment\r\nwithout review by any authority, as soon as Judiciary re-issued the\r\ndocuments in your name. After it must have been re-legalized, from original\r\ncontract awarded person, t your good self.\r\n\r\nThe Banque Suisse,  was the first, who paid the original contractor the\r\nfirst value, this over invoice value, does not concern him, it is only the\r\nSwiss Bank who handles the vault and has power to pay it, after judiciary\r\nmust have, re-legalized the Third-Party Indemnity Bond on your behalf.\r\n\r\n2. Tranche transfer means, the special online banking, which Banque Suisse\r\ncreates for you to handle personally per limits, as the server permits per\r\nday until the vault of the usd$85M is cleared.  That is what I mean by per\r\ntranche transfer from you, to the bank server daily. So, there will be no\r\neye brows raised on the remittance to you. Online banking has been the\r\npreferred mode of payment, registered for the claim of the usd$85M, that is\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIn a strong terms, you can reach the legal advocate:\r\n\r\nName: Sam Smith\r\nEmail:  legal.dept@notarybills.org\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is the legal consultant to the reviewed documents of the over invoice\r\ncontract.  Also, reach the bank (Banque Suisse):\r\n\r\nDirector: Mr S.Nelson\r\nEmail: banquesuissedepositdept@headoffice-dpt.co\r\n\r\nSeek the payment plan from the two institutes , for prompt facilitation of\r\nthe transaction of the over invoice.  Remember to attach your ID, phone\r\nnumber and address for the facilitation to start. I have made your payment\r\nrequest officially.\nBest regards,\r\nDesmond William"

        "body": "Hello Gerardo,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I appreciate your detailed explanation about the Indemnity Bond and its role in the over-invoicing process. It's fascinating to learn about these legal frameworks and how they connect different parties.\n\nYou mentioned a Third Party Indemity Bond, which allows me to claim the over invoice legally. Could you please elaborate more on this? How does it work exactly?\n\nAlso, I'm intrigued by the concept of Tranche transfer that you explained. It seems like a secure way to handle large amounts of money. However, could you clarify what you mean by \"per limits, as the server permits per day\"? Is there a specific limit on how much can be transferred daily?\n\nYou suggested reaching out to a legal advocate and Banque Suisse for further information. Could you provide more details about who I should contact specifically? \n\nLastly, while I understand your request for my ID, phone number and address, I must apologize as I am not comfortable sharing such personal information online due to privacy concerns.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nGerardo"
