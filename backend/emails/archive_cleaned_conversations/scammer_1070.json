        "body": "Hello Mr. William,\n\nThank you for your response. I understand your concerns and I'm here to provide you with the necessary information. The funds in question are supposedly located at the IMF office, which is the International Monetary Fund.\n\nWe came across this information through our internal database, which tracks unclaimed funds that are due to be delivered to their rightful owners. Our goal is to assist individuals like yourself in receiving their funds without any further delay or complications.\n\nRegarding the payment, it is required as a processing fee to ensure that your funds are safely delivered to your home address or transferred to your bank account. This fee covers administrative costs and ensures a smooth transaction.\n\nTo make the payment, we suggest using gift cards as a secure method of transfer. Once you purchase the cards, simply scratch them and send us a scan copy of the cards for verification purposes.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use Ria Money Transfer or visit our office and provide us with the payment slip for confirmation.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. We are here to assist you in any way possible.\n\nBest regards,\nMr.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
