But it does not mean that genuine transaction is not going on globally certainly there is, Let me use this great chance to reiterate to you once again that the only way we can forge ahead and claim this fund for our mutual benefit as anticipated is to shun being skeptically and bias of mind to each other, do not allow skeptic and doubt to destroy trust and confidence we have build to each other all this day’s we have come to know each other in respect to the realization of this project.\r\n\r\nBe well informed that the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the united kingdom has placed all what you have being hearing in the Internet just to frustrate and bias the mind of foreigners who wish to assist those top officials that has an opportunity to transfer fund out of this country. Remember this is a third world country where if you have your connection and position you can do anything and go free. If you can go down to memory lane, you will agree with me that the Nigerian politicians, our governors, ministers and our foreign ambassadors in all part of countries in almost the whole world, has misused their position to serve our great country Nigeria by using their position to siphoned and fraud the public fund out of this country into their private bank account abroad through the assistance of a foreigners for their mutual benefit, all this abnormality they are committing brings distress, diseases, poverty and detriments to all Nigerians. So, My dear Clarice , because of the kind of money that has been transferred outside this country, base on that outcome the present government place whatever they may wish in the Internet just to bias the mind of foreigners who wish to assist those top officials to transfer their fund out of the shore of this country. Remember Nigeria was under military regime over 34 years that has brought bad and fraudulent government all this years. Could you believe that we are just witnessing Democracy just approximately 24years now, l am an renowned, influential and recognize Banker (attorney) here in Lagos-Nigeria and will be in a better position to tell you the truth and what is happening over here, no body today no matter where he or she comes from can be able to tell more better of your country than you, is not possible no matter his/her level of education. Please go ahead and disregard all what you are seeing in the Internet as the Nigerian Government is responsible for that just to bias the mind of foreigners, but deep down in their mind they are still transferring the public fund outside of this country, bringing more and more poverty, sufferings to a lot of people over here.\r\n\r\n l have given you my word as a true Christian and l want you to reciprocate to that as l can never, never mislead you in any form, my dream of coming to your country and Live must be manifested and this is the only opportunity l have and can never let it slip out of my hands. l am a recognized and influential Banker (attorney) over here Lagos-Nigeria, l am also a man of integrity and transparency that has a name to maintain in the society, l have not sold my conscience to the {SATAN DE DEVIL} as l am still a normal human been that has conscience, beside l am a member of Saint Molumber in the Catholic Church so l can never, never be little myself or indulge in any act to defraud or mislead you as my conscience forbid such act, So you have nothing to worry about. Remember that if this fund finally hit your chosen bank account it will definitely change our entire future no matter any kind of burden we are being going through all the past years. l am not trying to change your stand or your motive in respect to your decision but because l will use your name to secure all the necessary vital documents in the judiciary on your behalf and submitted it to the bank on your favor, and of course l have sunk in all my life savings into this project before it come to this final stage. So you go ahead and send to me your information .\r\n\r\nJAJA MORRIS"
