        "body": "Dear Mr Douglas,\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is to acknowledge the receipt  of your mail all information therein noted I have counseled several of the beneficiaries who were able to confide in me. So I know how you feel. Miscreants hijacked the process of genuine offers like this to cajole innocent people. I am afraid that with the type of confidence that internet communication is losing, the major goal of E communication which is making the world a global village will be gradually eroded. I think it is rather unfortunate that you will be entertaining doubts at this stage of the transaction.\r\nI occupy a lucrative position in the United Nations as the (Chief Financial officer(CFO) UNCC and cannot afford to contact you with what is not true, you may not have the\r\nopportunity I have in the financial world. I want to let you know more about myself so that you will be rest assured of whom you are transacting with.\r\nI urge you to try your best to get things done. Let me tell you, if you look at the constraint every human being has financially no matter\r\nthe level you will not be able to do anything. Big firms and corporations do borrow money even the government does also to accomplish\r\none goal or the other. You have to find a way of getting things around. For any task you find lay before\r\nyou, you have to think of the very best options to accomplishing it.Do not put up a defeatist attitude towards it rather wake up your\r\nthinking faculty and get the best solution available, making a sacrifice which is a veritable tool of determination to achieve a goal\r\nin life. Opportunity is like a light that flashes in within a very short time period and goes and if you do not take advantage of it\r\nwhile it subsists, you may likely lose it forever. Personally I am always awake to this realization that is why I do not joke with any\r\nopportunity that opens up.\r\n\r\nWe only have this  week to get your funds to you and failure to that the transaction might be canceled/terminated.\r\nFinally,Like I stated in my previous message , as soon as you send the 290 Euros for processing fee, your  Nine Hundred and Thirty Thousand Dollars (US$930,000.00) will be released to your bank account immediately or any other mode of payment.\r\n\r\nWe await your urgent and soonest email.\nRegards\r\nMr. Adams Gabriel\r\nChief Financial officer(CFO)\r\nUNCC ."
