        "body": "Hello Mr. William Lee,\n\nThank you for your email. It's quite exciting to hear about this payment! I must say, it's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nI'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify a few things for me? You mentioned an MTCN Money Transfer Control Number and sender's name, but I don't see them in the email. Could you provide those details?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a question \"What Color\" with an answer \"White\". What does this mean exactly?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about how this came to be? How was my name selected by the United Nations for this fund transfer?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLee"
