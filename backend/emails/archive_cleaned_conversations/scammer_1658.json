However, I have a few questions before we proceed further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain to me in more detail about this activation fee? What exactly does it cover and why is it necessary?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that I can pay any amount now and the balance later. Could you clarify how much the total activation fee is?\n\nLastly, once the fund is activated, how will I be able to access it? Will it be through Western Union or some other means?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
