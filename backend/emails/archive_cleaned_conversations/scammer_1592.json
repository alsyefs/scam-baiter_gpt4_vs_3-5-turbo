        "body": " Hello my good friend,\nI think it is the time to share with you the good news about your fund and also tell you what to do, but first I want to ask, are you still willing to receive this fund's $22.7 million? Because after our last deliberation with the ECOWAS Payment Verification Panel over your fund, the conclusion of the meeting motivated me to write to you to let you know that you can receive your funds now.\nMeaning that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWASPVP) has set your fund free and ready to be transferred to you as soon as you identify yourself.\nAnd you will receive the funds within 14 working days as long as you follow my directives, the fund will be transferred to you without any hindrance or any form of delay.\nAnd it is obvious that in the past, you worked with a group of corrupt people who could not do the appropriate thing for you to receive your funds rather they cost you a necessary fortune.\nI wait to hear back from you. That is if you are still interested in receiving these funds, for me to direct you the way forward and give you the right channel to receive your funds perfectly without any further delay.\nI prefer you acknowledge this message through this email address: \nmemberpanel666@gmail.com\nThank you,\nDr Hassan    "

It's always a pleasure to hear from you.\n\nI must say, this is quite intriguing. I am indeed interested in receiving these funds. However, could you please provide more details? For instance, how was it decided that these funds would be released to me? And what exactly does the process of receiving them entail?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the ECOWAS Payment Panel and their role in this? I'm not very familiar with them and would love to learn more.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nDionne"

As a lot of reports come from\r\ninternational communities over fund transfer from West Africa States. In\r\nthat regard the panel was set up to oversee the failings of fund transfers\r\nfrom West African State, because some people's funds have been headed in\r\none ministry or the other for a very long time for no reason.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what the panel is doing now, when they go through your file and\r\nthey see that the reason for holding the transfer has no meaning, they will\r\nrelease the fund to be transferred to the receiver or the beneficiary.\r\n\r\nAnd be rest assured that the funds would be transferred to the account you\r\nwill provide immediately the panel validates the approval in your name.\r\n\r\nVery urgent.\nThanks,\r\nDr Hassan."
