I am the personal accountant to Fatima Mattie, who\r\nwas a Gold Merchant.\r\n\r\nOn the 4-12-2020, Fatima Mattie was involved in a car accident.

        "body": "Hello Mr. Albert Sajid,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and explaining the situation. I'm sorry to hear about the car accident involving Fatima Mattie. It must have been a difficult time for everyone involved.\n\nI understand that you have been trying to locate any of Fatima Mattie's extended relatives without success. It's unfortunate that no one has been found so far. However, I'm curious about how you came across my name since we share the same surname. Could you please provide more details on how you found me?\n\nAlso, I appreciate your assurance that this is a legitimate matter and will undergo proper procedures according to the financial and legal regulations. However, before proceeding further, I would like to know more about the specific amount of money left behind by Fatima Mattie and how it is currently being held in your bank.\n\nFurthermore, could you clarify what role you expect me to play in this process? You mentioned sharing the money between us, but I would like to understand the exact nature of my involvement and responsibilities.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMattie"
