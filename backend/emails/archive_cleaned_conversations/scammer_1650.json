        "body": "Hello Mr. Mark Paul,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite exciting to hear about this opportunity! I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain more about this portfolio? What exactly does it contain?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the SECURITY COMPANY. Could you tell me more about them? How long have they been in business and where are they located?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"
