These are the documents banks will\r\nask from attorneys who come for fund claims or contract payment and so on.\r\n\r\nNow let's pick a topic: 1. How do you claim a house that is willed to you?\r\n\r\nThere are two basic documents that are required and are a priority to\r\nobtain. This is the *death certificate*, which is acquired at the Civil\r\nRegistry of the municipality in which the death occurred, and the\r\ncertificate of last will and testament, which is issued on request by the\r\nMinistry of Justice.\r\n\r\nMandatory documentation:\r\n\r\n*A copy of the Death Certificate*. A copy of the Certificate from the\r\nCentral Registry of Last Wills. A copy of the Will or the Inheritance\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\nWhat is the process of inheritance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the inheritance process to begin, *a will must be submitted to probate*.\r\nThe probate court reviews the will, authorizes an executor and legally\r\ntransfers assets to beneficiaries as outlined. Before the transfer, the\r\nexecutor will settle any of the deceased's remaining debts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*How to Determine Entitlement to an Inheritance*\r\n\r\n   1. Determine if the decedent created a Will or Trust (an estate plan)\r\n   2. Request copies of the Will or Trust from the Executor (for a Will) or\r\n   Trustee (for a Trust)\r\n   3. Review the terms of the Will or Trust to determine whether you are\r\n   named as a beneficiary.\r\n\r\nLet's put a break here, allow the lawyer to source further information for\r\nyou here in the ministry.\r\n\nYours regards,\r\n\r\nMelanie Joly"

You're right, in such cases, the court usually divides the funds among the deceased's offspring or holds onto the assets until a valid claim is made.\n\nIf no claim is made within a certain period, it's possible that the government could step in and consider these assets as abandoned properties. However, this typically happens only after a given grace period has passed without any claims from potential owners.\n\nIn situations where the deceased's debt exceeds their asset value, it's less likely for the government to make a claim. This is because those debts would generally be claimed by creditors first.\n\nI hope this information helps! Do you have any other questions on this topic? I'm here to assist you further if needed.\n\nBest wishes,\nLois"
