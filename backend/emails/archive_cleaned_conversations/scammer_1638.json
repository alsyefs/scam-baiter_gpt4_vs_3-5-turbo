However, this correspondence is UN-official and\nprivate, and it should be treated as such. I also guarantee you that\nthis transaction is hitch free from all what you may think of. I am\nMr. Ming Mui, Vice President & Branch Manager, Industrial and\nCommercial Bank of China (USA) NY, Canal Street Main Branch, New York\nand I am contacting you based on Trust and confidentiality that will\nbe attached to this transaction.\nThe Management and the Legal department of our bank (Industrial and\nCommercial Bank of China (USA) NY) in a recent meeting recommended\nthat the account of late Mr. Wiiliam Aucoin, who was one of my branch\ndepositors, should be declared Dormant, confiscated and the\ndepositor's fund sent to the Bank Treasury according to U.S.A Banking\nand financial law. Late William Aucoin died on 28th June 2010 of\ncancer at the Aventura Hospital and Medical Center in Aventura,\nFlorida. The bank, having made several efforts to contact any of his\nrelatives to claim this money but without success decided to\nconfiscate the fund and declare it public fund.\nLate Mr. William Aucoin was an account holder in my branch; he owns a\ndollar account with a huge sum of money deposited in a Secret account\nwith my branch. In fact, since his death, no next of kin of the\naccount holder nor any relative of him has shown up for the claim of\nthis fund, this is because he has the account as a secret account\nthus, he left all the documents for the deposit with me as his account\nofficer and financial advisory.\nThis is where I am interested and where I want you to come in, I want\nyou to come in as a relative of the deceased; do not bother that you\nare not in any way related to him because I am in position to affix\nyour name as the next of kin to the deceased and no one will question\nit since I am the officer in charge of the account. I will give you\nthe relevant documents and contacts to file the application and then I\nwill effect the approvals for the transfer of the fund to your\nnominated bank account. I will be the one to provide the vital\ndocuments for the claims of the money and then advise you exactly how\nwe should handle it.\nPlease include your telephone number when replying to this mail so I\ncan call to give you more information as soon as you indicate your\nwillingness to assist in this transaction. The whole Procedures will\nlast only 14 working days to get the fund retrieved successfully\nwithout trace even in future. After the transfer of the money to your\nnominated bank account, we shall share the money 50-50.that is I will\nhave 50% while you will have 50%.\nKindly respond promptly so that I can advise you on what to do next.\nPlease reply to this my home email address:( \nmingmui05@gmail.com\n )\nI will be waiting to hear from you.\nYours truly,\nMing Mui.\nVice President & Branch Manager,\nIndustrial and Commercial Bank of China (USA) NY."

        "body": "Dear Marc,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your prompt response to my email. Firstly, let me state once again that I have been prompted to trust you and will fully depend on you to show me maximum trust, honesty and confidentiality and above all, follow my directives strictly to enable us to achieve success in this transaction. As you will understand, this transaction is 100% successful as long as you follow my directives/instructions, in 14 working days from now or more, we will finish all documentary aspects of this transaction and the funds transferred.\r\n\r\nI will demand that you give me the privilege to handle this transaction with my professional experience and position here in my bank. I have to at this point ask for your sincere confidentiality, please assure me this and keep to it that the next person to you does not know about this transaction as we have to keep it highly confidential. You should know that I am working with the bank and a Manager in that matter hence my position and job will be at risk should you expose this transaction to anyone.\r\n\r\nThe basic requirement here is that as you will know I do not want to let my bank know I am behind the transfer so all our communications will be restricted to email unless on a very important and urgent matter then you can reach me on my direct telephone number and if it is convenient to discuss with you at the particular time, we will discuss and if it is not convenient for us to discuss, then I will call you immediately it is convenient for me to talk with you. The issue of documentation is no problem; I will handle that as soon as we commence the transfer process. I am ready for this deal to be accomplished and I wish so from you please. My bank will have this approved since everything about this deposit is with me and the fund is in my branch and I would be the one to handle everything since it is in my branch.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm your details. As for what is expected of you in this transaction:\r\n\r\n1 Your full name and address\r\n\r\n2. Name of your next of kin\r\n\r\n3. Your telephone(Whatsapp number preferably)\r\n\r\n4 Your profession\r\n\r\n5. Copy of either your passport or ID.\r\n\r\nThe fund would be transferred through a more secured telegraphic wire transfer means with evidence proving the genuine source of the fund and you as the legitimate beneficiary of the fund and no government agency can stand against it. With my experience in financial matters, I will handle this. Please do not call me on my office telephone number because it will be unsecured to discuss this transaction in my office. Calling me on my office telephone number would mean a stop to this transaction because all calls that come into my bank telephone lines are completely monitored and if you call me, your call would be recorded and that means we already knew each other.\r\n\r\nPlease get back to me today with the above stated information so that I will be able to extract the deposit agreement and then make an official application of the claim in your name and submit it to the board that meets once every week. As soon as I receive your assurance along with the information above, I will advise you on what to do next. For any question you may want to ask please send it to me by email, I am very ready to answer them. I am guaranteed that they will give the approval instantly as the money is in my branch.\r\n\r\nAttached is my official ID\r\n\nTruly Yours,\r\n\r\nMr. Ming Mui"
