        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. It's quite a surprise to hear about this fund, I must say! \n\nBefore we proceed, could you please explain a bit more about how this fund came into existence? And why has it been assigned to me specifically? I'm just trying to understand the whole situation better.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the high court of justice approval is and why it's necessary for me to pay for it?\n\nAs for the payment method, I think I would prefer the ATM Master Card option. It sounds convenient and easy to use. But again, I'd like some more details on how this process works.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nP.S: Please note that due to privacy concerns, I won't be able to provide my full name, address or phone number at this stage. Once everything is clear and we move forward with the process, we can discuss these details in a secure manner.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
