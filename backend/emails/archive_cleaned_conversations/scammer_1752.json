It sounds like a very complex situation indeed.\n\nHowever, I must admit, I'm not entirely clear on some of the details you've shared. Could you please clarify what exactly is in the box? You mentioned it was declared as gold materials but also referred to it as money. \n\nAlso, could you explain more about how this process works? How would claiming ownership of this box help resolve your current predicament?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon and learning more about your situation.\n\nBest wishes,\nThaddeus"
