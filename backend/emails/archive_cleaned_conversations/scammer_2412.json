Meanwhile, if you accept\r\nto stand as my trustee to receive the money for proper investment in China,\r\nthen I will give you all the complete information that may be required.\r\n\r\nThis is because after my explanations to the bank about my living status\r\nnow, they advised me to look for mature and trusted foreign partner who\r\nwill help me to conduct and transfer the money to his position due to the\r\npolicy of where I am living as a refugee that is prohibited for me to have\r\na direct claim over the deposit.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I pledge to give you 40% of the total fund for your\r\nassistance, while 60% will belong to me and my remaining child as I have a\r\nbright future for her. I hope and wait for a positive reply from you as\r\nsoon as possible. Attached here are our family pictures and my late husband\r\nfor you to see. Thank you. I am waiting for your response. here is my email\r\naddress :\r\n\nSincerely,\r\nMrs. Talia Adisa Daniel"
