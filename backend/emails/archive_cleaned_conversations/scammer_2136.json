        "body": "Sequel to the above specifications, the management of the Fund Reconciliation Department here in New York City USA, wishes to let you know that your fund worth a total amount of $15.5 million is long overdue payment, every precept regarding your funds has been concluded. You will be receiving your funds from this Surrogate Court Office any moment from now. I take, keep and make reports of every transaction done here in the USA. Investigations gathered by the Fund Regulatory Agency {IMF}, shows you have been receiving numerous emails from several offices requesting you to claim your funds. In some cases, you tried a lot but still the transfer or delivery was not completed due to one reason or the other. The fact is that you are stuck between the chains which make it impossible for you to differentiate the real office from its counterfeit.\nI know you will be expecting to hear from me regarding this delivery after the last attempt to get it over. The fact is that I understand you're been into so many transactions and I decided to stay clear so that you will understand the truth about everything going on within the internet.\nI noticed that the only real offices that had ever contacted you in respect to your funds were the United State Embassy Benin Republic and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It was brought to our notice that the former Ambassador to the republic of Benin, Ambassador, made a voluntary effort to bring your funds along to your home address but couldn't due to some fall-out on your ends. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York came up to make a wire transfer but they said you couldn't meet the fee demand for the transfer, so they gave up on you. In a more proper and legalized manner, the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve Bank solicited the Fund Reconciliation Department to allow your fund to be Credited as a Visa Card and be delivered to your home address through the Agent. These options, we supposed, could be the best, easiest and the most efficient way to have you get hold of your long awaited United Nations approved funds.\nLike you were told by the Federal Reserve Bank aforementioned, your funds were transferred from about four different banks; Central Bank of Kenya, United Bank of Africa Benin Republic, Bank of America and Nat west bank London. In total, your funds were amounting to the tune of USD15.5 Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars As I speak, your funds have been credited in your Visa Card and also available as Cashier's Check well documented and packaged. The documented package will be delivered to your home address by your Agent here in NY, USA. The ONLY thing needed before your Agent can deliver your ATM CARD is the PROCUREMENT FILE of your funds. The procurement file is at the Origin Country of your funds in West Africa Benin Republic.\nFor the purpose of avoiding double payment on your end, I had an agreement with the IMF and Federal Reserve to document every charge necessary until the package gets to your home address. The analytical group of the two offices mentioned above had an accurate sum of $250.00 for Procurement. So it was constituted and officially submitted to the \"Court of Justice\" that the ONLY charge you will EVER pay before your package leaves our office here in USA to your home address is $250.00 for your Procurement File to be signed and conveyed down here in the USA and YOU WILL NEVER pay a dime again as agreed. I renowned and reputable USA Agency and I don't like an undocumented process that is why it had to be written down in Court that you will never pay any other money apart from the $250.00 \nThe $250.00 is for \"PROCUREMENT FEE\" (That is for someone to sign your file on your behalf)\n. USA Ambassador to Benin Republic, \"Ambassador, who will be coming to the United State in few days will have the Power of Attorney to stand in and sign on your behalf (since you can't travel down to Benin because of that) so that he can sign and bring along with him your PROCUREMENT FILE to me here to enable your Agent deliver your loaded ATM CARD to your home address by your Agent without any hitch.\nHowever, according to our agreement with the originated Country Benin Republic, all our communications should be on email for recording purpose so follow my instruction accordingly, even if you donâ€™t have the $250.00 try to borrow it and send it immediately today because this is your life opportunity and I donâ€™t want you to lose the chance any more.\nTherefore, the days of you being subjected to paying twice Double Payment is over as that is the case with some corrupt officials down there in Africa, whom always strife to subject beneficiaries to hard bureaucratic bottleneck, thereby making it impossible for most innocent citizens spread across the globe and the likes to claim what rightfully belongs to them. Thank GOD that your funds are here in NEW YORK SURROGATE COURT, USA and so we decided to follow the USA\nconstitutions so as to ensure that your money is in your hands this week. Without mincing words, it will be desirous if you consciously adhere to the above instruction by remitting the PROCUREMENT FEE calculated to be $250.00 down to the office of Ambassador, at the USA Consulate/Embassy in Benin Republic so that your ATM CARD could be deliver to your home address as soon as the Ambassador arrives here with your procurement file. The PROCUREMENT FEE of $250.00 is PAYABLE in two payment options:\nRECEIVER'S NAME FOR WORLD REMIT MONEY TRANSFER,\nRecipient Name: Elliot Oduh\nCountry: Benin Republic\nCity: Cotonou\nAmount: $250.00\nMTCN:\nSENDER'S NAME:\nI hope your immediate positive response with payment details or payment slip attachment once you make the payment to enable a speedy delivery of your CARD to your home address.\nKindly Still Update me With:\n1. Your Full Name:...\n2. Your Current Delivery Address:...\n3. Your Private Mobile Number for the Agent to Contact\nYou when he arrives:...\n4. Your Occupation:...\n5. \nCopy of your id card\n:...\nOnce again, I am sorry for the inconveniences you might have encountered in the past, in pursuit of your funds. Now that this office, Fund Reconciliation Department, is involved, you will have no cause to ever regret again as soon as you adhere to the above given instructions.\nRegards,\nMr. Thomas Montage.\nWhatsApp or text +22998118804\nContact Email (\nprivateofficeemail38@gmail.com\n)\nADMINISTRATIVE CHIEF JUDGE, SURROGATE COURT, 152 GENESEE ST, AUBURN, NY USA (NEW YORK STATE SUPREME COURT) NEW YORK CITY, USA."

It's fascinating to hear about all these different organizations and processes involved.\n\nSo, if I understand correctly, my funds are currently in New York City at the Surrogate Court Office? That's quite a distance from where I am! And it seems like there have been some complications with transferring these funds before?\n\nI'm also intrigued by this Visa Card option. It does sound like an efficient way to receive the funds. Could you tell me more about how that works? \n\nAnd it sounds like there's a fee for someone to sign my file on my behalf? Is that what the $100 is for? Just want to make sure I've got all the details straight.\n\nI'm also curious about this Agent who will be delivering my ATM card. Can you tell me more about them?\n\nLastly, could you clarify what you mean by \"the days of paying twice Double Payment is over\"? I'm not sure I fully understand that part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you!\n\nP.S. - You mentioned needing some personal information from me. While I'd love to help out as much as possible, I've been advised not to share personal details online for security reasons. Hope you understand!\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
