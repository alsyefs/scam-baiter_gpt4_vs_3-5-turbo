        "body": "  Greetings of peace and happiness to you, my name is Mrs. Serah Jones, I am terminally ill and have decided to donate my inheritance from my husband to you. No doubt, you may wonder how I got to know you and your information, and what informed my decision to Will my fortune to you, Dear, you have no cause to worry about these questions, I mean no harm. Regarding how I got your personal details, it is through the the help of the nurse assigned to attend to me in my private ward in this hospital, because I cannot surf on my own due to partial stroke, it is the nurse who surfs for me under my direction because I feel to donate my fortune to an individual and your profile was chosen.\nI am 58 years old woman with no child and have been diagnosed with acute cancer for about 2 years now, shortly after the death of my husband here , which made me hypertensive and resulted in a stroke. In my present condition, life is without meaning to me and hope has since eluded me, each day I give my entire existence a thought, I feel overpowered by gloom and despair, also saw nothing but death lurking around, All these are my reasons for deciding on using anything in my name for charity in which co-incidentally you have been favored as the beneficiary. I must tell you that I was truly touched by my inner mind to take this decision action, and I will advice you donâ€™t see your windfall as avenue for pleasure spree but should see it as an opportunity to build and grow your personal finances to an enviable level and help others, for both your benefit and the benefit of others, always put me in your prayers and ask God to forgive my sins and trespasses. I shall be undergoing major operations in less than two weeks from now and have willed my inheritance funds to you and to help the less-privileged around you.\nIf you are sure that you will use the donated fund as I have advised here, get back to me for more details. Thanks and regards\nMrs. Serah Jones.  \n "
