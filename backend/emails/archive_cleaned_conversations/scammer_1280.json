A foreigner (LATE NAZIR ADAM AHMAD) an oil\r\nMerchant /contractor, before his sudden death  due to (Corona-virus\r\ndisease)  deposited with my bank the sum of USD$10.2M: which, I\r\nsuccessfully kept with instruction that it MUST be released to his\r\nBENEFICIARY.\r\n\r\nNow, our bank is expecting the money to be claimed by the beneficiary as\r\ninstructed. Though many efforts had been made to get in touch with any\r\ndirect relative but all to no avail, because of that, some board of\r\ndirectors wants us to confiscate the money or declare it Bank's money soon.\r\n\r\nThis is why; I seek for your permission to PRESENT YOU as his BENEFICIARY\r\nso that the fund USD$10.2M would be transfer into your bank account for\r\nfuture INVESTMENT in your country. I KNOW HE IS NOT YOUR RELATION  BUT THE\r\nENTIRE DOCUMENT WILL BE PERFECTED TO YOUR NAME TO SUIT YOUR STAND AS THE\r\nBENEFICIARY.I am assuring you 100% free from any risk in this transaction.\r\n\r\nFinally, your share would be 40% of $10.2m. While 10% would be mapped out\r\nto settle ALL expenses while the balance 50% is for me, which I will also\r\ninvest in your country via your assistance.\r\n\r\nKinds regard\r\n\r\nMr. Andrew Joes"

Your\r\nsecurity is 100% guaranteed, be sure that everything will be successful, I\r\nwant your full cooperation from your side and I will do the same from this\r\nside to ensure that all arrangements here are perfectly in order, so don't\r\nbe worried or curious for any reason. I contacted you with faith hoping and\r\nbelieving in God that you will not betray me once the fund is transferred\r\nto your account.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should know that I am not doing this business because of the large\r\namount that is involved on it but rather the success of this business will\r\nbenefit both families from generation to generation as far as you follow\r\nthe instruction which I will be getting from our Insider in Bank's head\r\noffice who is the main KEY to success of this transaction, and you should\r\nknow that never a business to succeed without building trust to each other.\r\nI promise you that I will never let you down in this business either now or\r\nin the future and you assure me that as well. In fact, I am very much\r\ninterested to know whether you will be capable of doing this business with\r\nme in full confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will apply for release of the fund on your behalf with your account\r\ndetails, this will enable the Bank to process the payment officially to\r\nyour account and foreign exchange Approval will be issued in your name by\r\nthe National Treasury Department Of Finance in your favor legalizing the\r\ntransfer to your name as sole inheritor so that your Government or your\r\nBank will not question about source\\origin of the Fund as the National\r\nTreasury Department Of Finance has already Legalized and Authorize the\r\nTransfer under the backup cover of repatriation of earning, investing\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou should also send me your account information where you want the fund to\r\nbe transferred. If you can be fast, the Transfer will be concluded within 7\r\nbanking days but you should keep the business to yourself as top secret\r\nbecause success of this transaction is highly confidential. You should not\r\ntell your bank that money is coming to your account for now because they\r\ncan ask you early questions you may not be able to answer. I will tell you\r\nwhat and when to tell your bank with all the necessary documents to back up\r\nthe source and origin of the fund as legitimate funds from genuine sources.\r\nBelow is the data needed from you for processing the payment on your name\r\n\r\n\r\nBank account details in full......................\r\n\r\n1. Bank name:..................\r\n\r\n2. Account name:...................\r\n\r\n3. Account number:..............\r\n\r\n4. Bank address:..............\r\n\r\n5. Swift code:......\r\n\r\n6. IBAN number.....\r\n\r\n7. Attachment copy of your international passport or driver's license\r\n\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter whether there is money in your bank account or not\r\nbecause an empty existing bank account can still serve the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\nMr. Andrew"

I'm intrigued by the process of buying gold and dealing with local mining companies.\n\nCould you please elaborate more on these covered documents? What exactly do they entail and how do they ensure legality in both countries?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what information is being requested from me? I want to make sure we're on the same page before proceeding further.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJanice"

I'm curious, how did he manage to secure contracts with both the government and local mining companies? \n\nYou mentioned some covered documents that would verify legality here and in my country. Could you please elaborate on what these documents are? \n\nI'm eager to understand more about this process before we proceed further.\n\nThanks!\n\nBest wishes,\nJanice"
