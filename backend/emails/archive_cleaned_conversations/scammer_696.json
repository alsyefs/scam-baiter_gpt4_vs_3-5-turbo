        "body": "Hello Edward Ashante,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I can't believe that such an initiative is being carried out by the World Bank and United Nations. It's really heartening to know that there are efforts being made to compensate victims of scams.\n\nI'm curious about how this process works though. How did you determine who the victims are? And how was it decided that each victim would receive Three Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about what you mean by \"this award will have to be first cleared by access bank\"? What does it mean for the award to be cleared?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but I'm just trying to understand everything better. Looking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nMarvin"

        "body": "Dear Marvin,\r\n\r\n\r\nI confirm receipt of your email and its contents were noted and understood.\r\n\r\nYour name appeared as one of the scammed victims.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this payment of the $3,500,000 to all victims is that the\r\nWorld bank and the United Nations reasoned that some of those scammed\r\nvictims must have lost a huge sum of money ranging from $5.000,000,\r\n$10,000,000, $15,000,000 etc to scammers.  So they decided to map out that\r\nsum of $3,500,0000 for the compensation irrespective of how much the\r\nscammed victim lost.\r\n\r\nThe Access bank will have to give their clearance to such a victim to\r\nensure that he or she is truly the person to receive this compensation to\r\navoid ghost victims.\r\n\r\nThis email was not sent to you alone.  It was equally sent to those other\r\nvictims that were involved.  Some contact information of some victims were\r\nsent to me by the United Nations and I cannot explain how they got to know\r\nabout the actual victims.\r\n\r\nSo you should not get bothered or worried about this development.  All I\r\nneed is for you to confirm to us if you are the actual victim of this to\r\nenable us to proceed.\r\n\nEdward Ashante"

However, I'm a bit confused about how this process works. Could you please explain more about how the Access bank will give clearance? And what does it mean by \"ghost victims\"?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details on how my contact information was obtained by the United Nations?
