Can you please provide me with more details about the situation? I want to make sure I understand everything correctly before taking any further steps.\n\nCould you explain why there is a fee that needs to be paid in order for me to receive my funds? Is this a standard procedure? Also, how exactly does purchasing an Amazon Gift Card prove that I am still alive and ready to receive my funds?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter and look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
