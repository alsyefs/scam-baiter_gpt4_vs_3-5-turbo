The custom stamp duty will be around $300 to $350 by now. So contact the customs officers of which they will tell you the actual cost of it now. I believe you are getting your ATM CARD today or not? Do get back to me now.\nThanks\nMr Keistalina Georgieva\nTHE IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR   "

Firstly the custom \r\nstamp duty is the stamp the custom must put on the parcel of your ATM CARD\r\nand certificates which they will ship to you. The stamp on the parcel shows\r\nthat your parcel has been examined and crosscheck by the customs of the \r\nairport. Then the deliver man will immediately be allowed to come and\r\ndeliver your parcel to you.\r\n\r\nI want you to understand that there is no way your parcel will not pass \r\nthrough a custom at the airport before it is deliver to you. It is on the \r\nprocess that the custom officer will discovers what rhe delivery man carries\r\nand the value of the parcel. Again your ATM CARD is just a cashless ATM \r\nCARD. It is like a cash the deliver man is bringing to you. It is not like\r\nthe normal ATM CARD the banks gives to their customers that has an account\r\nwith them. This ATM CARD is loaded with $45 million dollars inside. As soon\r\nas you receive it, either you offload your money inside your account or you\r\ncan be using it every time and everyday. But the limit of cash out in a day\r\nis $40,000 a day if you are using the ATM CARD directly. So it is better you\r\noffload the money into your personal account. So with all the documents, \r\nyour bank will not suspect you or you will not have any problem with the \r\nauthority in your country.\r\n\r\nThe money is an awarded money to you by the IMF. Every year will do award a\r\ncertain amount of money to people. In other words we help citizens to better\r\ntheir lives and to be a help to other citizens around them. So i urge you to\r\ndo your best to receive your fund ATM CARD soon if not we will call it back\r\nand it will be given to another person this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr Keistalina Georgieva\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Původní e-mail ----------\r\nOd: Robert <we27171@***.com>\r\nKomu: transactionsectionpay01@seznam.cz\r\nDatum: 8. 2. 2024 23:24:07\r\nPředmět: Re: 700 19TH STREET NW, WASHINGT\r\n\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello Mr. Keistalina Georgieva,\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response.

        "body": "Hello Robert,\n\nThank you for your response and your interest in understanding the process. The custom stamp duty is a form of tax that is levied on goods that are being transported internationally. It's like a seal of approval from customs officials, indicating that they have inspected the parcel and it's cleared to be delivered.\n\nThe amount for the custom stamp duty can vary depending on several factors such as the type of goods, their value, and the destination country. It's a standard procedure followed by all countries to ensure compliance with their laws and regulations.\n\nAs for the ATM card, it's not directly related to the customs process. This ATM card is a special one loaded with funds awarded to you by IMF. You can use this card to withdraw money from any ATM machine or transfer the funds into your personal account.\n\nI hope this clarifies your doubts. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
