        "body": "Hello Tom Butler,\n\nThank you for your response and the detailed information. I appreciate your advice on stopping any further dealings with other parties until we finalize this process. \n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message. Could you please clarify what you mean by \"the process has been stopped and further\"? Also, could you explain more about the \"overdue payment\" to South Pacific Sun Pty Ltd company of Australia? I don't recall having any overdue payments.\n\nRegarding the documents you requested, I'm afraid I can't provide my passport data page or driver's license due to privacy concerns. Is there another way to verify my identity that doesn't involve sharing such sensitive personal information?\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on what happens if I fail to supply the documents? You mentioned referring my case to a department but didn't specify which one.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTiffany"
