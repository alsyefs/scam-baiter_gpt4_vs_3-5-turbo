I appreciate all the effort you've put into this.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please explain more about the Hardcover insurance policy? How does it protect my fund?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details on the different courier options? What makes Sprint Post Courier service the cheapest and easiest way to deliver?\n\nLastly, I'd like to know more about how this fund was confirmed as authentic and real by the president of United States and FBI. That sounds very impressive!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nHoward"
