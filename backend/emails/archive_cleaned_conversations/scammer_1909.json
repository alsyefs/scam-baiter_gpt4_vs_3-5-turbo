I'm honored that you've chosen me to help carry out this noble task.\n\nHowever, I must admit that I'm a bit overwhelmed by the responsibility you're entrusting me with. Could you please provide more details about how this process works? For instance, how will the funds be transferred? And what kind of charities do you have in mind for these donations?\n\nAlso, while I understand the need for some personal information to facilitate this process, I'm not comfortable sharing all the details you've requested at this stage. Is there another way we can proceed without needing my full address or a copy of my passport or driver's license?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCaryn"
