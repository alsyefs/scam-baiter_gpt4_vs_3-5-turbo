        "body": "Good day  my Dear Friend, i contacted you on Facebook and i could have send you the massage i have for you through Facebook but my Facebook account is acting up . You can make a lot of changes in the life of others with this great offer from the Lord through me to you , most especially the poor at heart , and the less privileged. Firstly , I think i would start all with a proper introduction of myself.\nI am Mrs.Rosemary  ,A widow to Late James.I am 62 years old ,suffering from long time cancer of the breast . From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than two months according to my doctor , because the stage at which my cancer is (Level 4) ,it is so critical and also to a very severe stage.My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than 2 months and I am so scared about it. My late husband and i both grew up in a motherless home in Australia we got married and we travel to the United States for our wedding and we decided to stay back there simply because it is a lovely place to stay and we were given a permanent stay after so many years of stay and also we have no child of our own due to one problem and the other ,so we decided to adopt a child in motherless home as our child before my husband had fatal accident which leads to his death .so am alone now for the past 27 years with my adopted son named Charles before he grew up and got married to lovely lady Anita from Canada (Qubec) which they gave birth to 2 lovely children in State before they relocated to France for a stay due to the nature of my Son's work\nSince the death of my late husband I decided not to re-marry which the Bible is against even though i wish i had . It is late now you know,and age is no longer on my side.but i still believe the lord will send me someone that will make me smile which is you because the bible says in the book of  Psalms 119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live, and let me not ashamed of my hope.\nPsalms 138: 7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou will revive me......\nPsalms 145:18Psalms 57: 7 My heart is fixed. O God my heart is fixed, I will sing & give praise\nPsalms51: 17 The sacrifices of God are broken spirit, a broken &  contrite heart, O God thou will not despise.\npsalms 41: 1 Blessed is he that considered the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble.\nTwo of my favorite verses: Philippians 2:27: For indeed he was sick nigh unto death, but God had mercy on him & that on him only, but on me also,lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.( I always say this in my mind )   \nMy adopted son called Charles the doctor to ask about my health and the doctor explain to him on phone,and he told the doctor that he will be coming to hospital i was in Switzerland. how ever i was not able to speak with my son on phone due to situation i was not able to talk but i can write on a paper to talk with the doctor then.unfortunately that was the last time i heard from my son,which the doctor later told me that my son and his family died in an plane they board from France (AIR FRANCE FLIGHT 447)crashed landed into the Atlantic ocean which made  my condition to be critical now,so i have no family to call no now,i have no grand son and grand daughter to call me grand Mum anymore.\n Am hopeless now, so i need some one that have fear of the lord,which i can trust will all what i have to tell him or her to do in the lord's works.My late Husband was very wealthy and Missionary after his death,i inherited all his business and wealth  with mine too.so once the doctor has advice me that i may not live for more than three month and am on life supporting machine for now .so i decided to give out all this wealth,to contribute to the development of the church in Africa,America,Asia and Europe.which i have prayed over it.So, I now decide to give all of my wealth, by contributing to the development of the motherless baby homes,less privileges, needy, poor, charity homes,widows and Cancer patient too in your country and i just want you to forget about the distance between me and you. I am willing to donate the sum of $15,000,000.00, which is still the major inheritance i have which my late husband left behind in my name . I wish you could be someone who i could trust with all my heart,to make this wish of mine come true despite the my prayers over you before i get to contact you. I want you to help me claim my funds from where it has been deposited but the question once more is CAN I TRUST YOU?"

        "body": "Greetings, Dear Friend.\r\n\r\nI'm sorry to interrupt your everyday activities, but I must ask that you\r\nread this email quickly since it calls for a timely answer.\r\n\r\nI am Mrs. Rosemary Paul, a widow of the late Dr. Abdulaziz Paul, who was\r\noriginally from the Kingdom of Bahrain but now resides in Nairobi, Kenya. I\r\nam 71 years old and have had breast cancer for a very long time. My\r\nsituation is seriously worsening, and my private doctor estimates that I\r\nmay only have six months to live because the disease has progressed to the\r\nworst and most severe stage.\r\n\r\nFive years ago, my late spouse and my one and only kid passed away; his\r\ndemise was politically driven. My late husband owned and operated a\r\nsuccessful Gold and Diamond business in Nairobi, Kenya. He was a very\r\nsuccessful businessman who was quite wealthy. After his death, I received\r\nfull ownership of his firm and assets. According to my physicians, I could\r\nonly have six months to live. I have made the decision to donate\r\n$15,600,000.00 USD (Fifteen Million Six Hundred Thousand United States\r\nDollars) to aid in the growth of Humanitarian Organizations in your country.\r\n\r\nI found your email address during an urgent web search and my good spirit\r\nhas led me to you as a sincere person. I couldn't take this money to my\r\ngrave therefore I've decided to send it to you so you may help the poor,\r\norphans, students, and widows. Please know that the money is at a bank in\r\nNairobi, Kenya, where it will be safe and secure. When you come back to me,\r\nI will provide you all the information you need to get this money released\r\nfrom the bank and put into your bank account.\r\n\r\nPlease submit the information below so that we can go forward.\r\n\n1. Your Complete Names:\r\n2. Your Complete Address:\r\n3. Your Mobile Phone Numbers:\r\n4. Your Profession:\r\n\r\nI eagerly anticipate your favorable reaction.\r\n\r\nSincere regards,\r\n\r\nMrs. Rosemary Paul."

I appreciate your kind intentions and willingness to donate such a significant amount of money. However, before we proceed, I have a few questions that I hope you can clarify for me.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about your late husband's Gold and Diamond business? I am curious to know how he managed to achieve such success in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nSecondly, I would like to understand the process of releasing the funds from the bank in Nairobi. Could you explain what steps need to be taken and how long it might take for the money to be transferred into my bank account?\n\nLastly, I would like to know more about your current health condition. You mentioned that your situation is worsening due to breast cancer. Have you sought any medical treatments or second opinions regarding your prognosis?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRigoberto"
