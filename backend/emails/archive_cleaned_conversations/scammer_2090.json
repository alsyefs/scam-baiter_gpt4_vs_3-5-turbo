You see, in the year 2010 a total sum of $32.5M USD\r\nwas deposited with our bank by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and on\r\nOctober 3rd last year the funds were moved to the World Bank with the\r\ninstructions of the United Nation. And after the meeting held recently\r\nconcerning the accrued interest it was agreed that the interest should be\r\npaid to you as a compensation for being scammed some time ago. So we\r\ncontacted you based on the instruction we received from World Bank and you\r\nare to claim the funds via bank to bank wire transfer or we shall credit\r\nthe funds in ATM CARD and dispatch to your address. Although, this will\r\nwarrant you to visit our bank for signing the necessary documents\r\nconcerning the aforementioned funds before we can make the payment. I\r\nbelieve you can now understand the outcome of the funds and I must say you\r\nare very lucky to be remembered for this. Though, it happens often but not\r\nto this huge amount of $975,000.\r\nThanks for your understanding and do enjoy your weekend.\nRegards\r\nPaul"
