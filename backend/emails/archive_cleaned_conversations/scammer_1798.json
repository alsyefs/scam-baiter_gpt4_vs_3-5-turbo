        "body": "   Hello \nI am Mrs. Joyce Ray the wife of the late Mr. Richard Ray.\nI am an Asian American Citizen, my husband worked with the Brunei Shell Petroleum Co Sdn Bhd (BSP) for twenty years before he died in the year 2012.\nWe were married for ten years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only two weeks.\nSince his death I have decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home. When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of $5.5 Million with a Bank in Turkey. The bank management just wrote me as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this fund or rather issue a letter of authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over. Presently, I'm in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment for esophageal cancer. My doctor has told me that I have only a few months to live.\nIt is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations, Because my husband, relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them.\nPlease, I'm seeking for any honest person who will get the Funds from the Bank. And use this money to fund the poor, orphanages, widows and charity organizations.\nI took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by his greedy relatives. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision.\nI am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going if I die. Due to the state of my health. I can not communicate by phone because my illness has affected my throat. I prefer to communicate by email. I will appreciate it if you are willing and promise never to betray me when you receive this money in your bank account.\nAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact details of the bank in Turkey with the letter I will give you as she will be the one to assist you in laying claims for these funds.\nThanks\nYours Truly,\nMrs.Joyce Ray\nEmail to reply: \nmrsjoycerayjoyce0097@aol.com\n "
