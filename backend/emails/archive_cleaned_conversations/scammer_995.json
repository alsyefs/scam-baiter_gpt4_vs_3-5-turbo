It's quite interesting to hear about the diverse areas your principal is interested in investing in, from oil and gas to health care sector devices.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please elaborate more on the terms of the loan? What would be the interest rate and what kind of security does your principal require?\n\nAlso, could you provide some examples of previous investments made by your principal? I believe it would give me a better understanding of his investment style and preferences.\n\nLastly, regarding the physical meeting, where would this typically take place? Would it be in London or somewhere else?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAgustin"
