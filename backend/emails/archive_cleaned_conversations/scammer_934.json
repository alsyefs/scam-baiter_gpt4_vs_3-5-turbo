I returned to this office on the 19th\r\nof October, 2023 and during my official research I discovered an\r\nabandoned consignment box containing an undisclosed US Dollars\r\nbelonging to you as the legitimate beneficiary. Your contact email is\r\ntagged on the consignment.\r\n\r\nFrom my assumption, the consignment contains not less than\r\nUS$7.5million and it weighs approximately 35kg (Internal dimension:\r\nW58 x H146 x D72 (cm) effective Capacity: 560 L) and It is still left\r\nin our airport storage facility. Your consignment has its clearance\r\ndocuments, which includes Anti-Terrorist Clearance, Money Laundry\r\nClearance, United Nations Approval Certificate, I.M.F Approval\r\nCertificate, and World Bank Approval Certificate.\r\n\r\nThe consignment was sent from Barclays Bank London UK. I tried to know\r\nthe reason why your consignment is still abandoned here in our\r\nairport, and I found out that the former operation manager who left\r\nthis office some months ago with-held your consignment from your\r\ndiplomat for his own selfish interest despite your supporting\r\ndocuments are complete.\r\n\r\nI do not support injustice and criminality, and now that I have resume\r\nthis office as the new Operation Manager of George Bush\r\nIntercontinental Airport and in charge of your consignment, I will\r\nrelease your consignment to you since I do not see any reason why your\r\nconsignment was withheld when your supporting documents is verified\r\nlegal and complete. Therefore, you are required to come down to our\r\nairport to claim your consignment from my office.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour direct telephone number is needed for easier communication.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response.\r\n\r\nYours faithfully\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Albert Nicholas Operation Manager\r\nGeorge Bush Intercontinental Airport\r\n2800 N Terminal Rd, Houston,\r\nTX 77032, United States\r\nTel: +1 ((312) 788-7326?

        "body": "Hello Mr. Albert Nicholas,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and congratulations on your new position as the Operation Manager at George Bush Airport, Texas. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't aware that there was a box containing US Dollars belonging to me.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this? How did Barclays Bank London UK come into possession of my box? And why was it sent from there?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"the former operation manager who left this office some months ago your from your diplomat for his own selfish interest\"? It seems like some words might be missing in that sentence.\n\nI appreciate your commitment to justice and fairness. However, I'm currently unable to travel down to the airport due to personal reasons. Is there any other way I can claim my box?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRebecca"
