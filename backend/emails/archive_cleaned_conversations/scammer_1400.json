        "body": "Dear Mr. Timothy J. Sloan,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from Wells Fargo Bank. I hope you are doing well. I received your email regarding a fund payment that is supposedly in my custody. I must admit, this is quite surprising as I don't recall being involved in any such transaction.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about this fund? How did it come to be in my custody? And what is the purpose of the Affidavit of Claim Ownership that you mentioned?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know more about the required fee for obtaining the Affidavit of Claim Ownership. What is the fee for, and why does it need to be sent to Benin Republic? Is there any alternative method of payment besides RIA Transfer Service or Steam Wallet Card?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in clarifying these matters. Looking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnna"
