It's because here in United States many Companies use the Gift Cards to recharge office appliances, since the amount required for the insurance is not too big.\r\n2.) It's because it will make the expense less for you, since sending Cash abroad is a bit cost, so i think of making it less for you instead of paying extra for the transfer services.\r\nThese are just my reasons of requesting for a copy of Steam Wallet Gift Card or iTunes Gift Card of $50 instead of sending the Cash.\r\n\r\nThank you as we are waiting for you urgently.\nRegards,\r\nGreg Hewitt\r\nDHL Express (USA) Ltd."
