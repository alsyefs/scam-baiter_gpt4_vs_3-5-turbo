        "body": "  Very confidential message\nGood morning from Nigeria. If you\\'re alive and you\\'re reading this\nemail then I might have some very good news for you.\nI am Albert Sajid, the newly appointed Confidential Secretary to\ngovernor of the Central Bank of Nigeria. While going through the old\nfiles that my boss inherited from his predecessor, I saw a record in\nyour name for a payment in the value of US$23.5 which was claimed was\nfor a contract executed for one of my government agencies.\nI don\\'t know if you may be aware of this but it is a fact. In my\ncountry, so many strange things happen among government and public\nservants and only those who are well connected can be aware.\nIn my present position, as the Confidential Secretary to the governor,\nI can convince my boss and he will conveniently approve the release of\nthis payment to you as recorded but only through the due process and\nwe will share the funds 50% apiece after you may have received the\npayment.\nThis can only be possible if you can be sincere and discreet about it\nwithout mentioning my plan to anyone.\nIf you may not be interested then simply say so. However, this money\nis sitting freely and easily to be claimed.\nI need a private and direct telephone number by which I can reach you.\nI NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU DIRECTLY.\nWaiting to hear from you so I can start the plan immediately.\nYours sincerely,\nAlbert Sajid   "
