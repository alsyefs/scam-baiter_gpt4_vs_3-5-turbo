It's an honor to be in contact with you.\n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts of your message though. You mentioned something about my funds being diverted to Government Treasuries Account? Could you please explain more about that? \n\nAlso, you mentioned a sum of US Million Dollars and an ATM Visa Card. Is this some kind of prize or reward? How did I become eligible for such a large amount?\n\nAnd lastly, you asked me to purchase an ebay card or Tunes card and scratch it and attach the picture. What is the purpose of this?\n\nI'm sorry for all these questions but as you can imagine, this is all very new and surprising to me.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
