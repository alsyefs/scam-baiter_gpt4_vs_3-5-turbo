        "body": "Hello friend,\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick response.\r\n\r\nYour mail is well understood and I will appreciate it if you will work with\r\nme in this transaction with a good understanding and sincere heart.\r\n\r\nDuring the reporting process, I discovered in 2016 that my branch made\r\n($21,537,000.00) this money which the head office is not aware of.  This\r\namount is currently placed in what we call SUSPENSE ACCOUNT without any\r\nbeneficiary. As an officer of the Advanced Bank of Asia Ltd. (ABA Bank) in\r\nPhnom Penh, Cambodia, I cannot be directly connected to this money, so this\r\nis why I have to contact you for us to work so that you can assist receive\r\nthis money. I need you to stand as the original depositor of the money to\r\nenable my Head office grant approval for the release of this fund.\r\n\r\nThe said amount is acrued interest undocumented within the bank which has\r\nbeen placed in a suspense account. This amount will be registered under\r\nyour name as the beneficiary if you agree to work with me in this\r\ntransaction. This is a legal transaction in which we shall follow due\r\nprocess whilst claiming the fund with no retribution to all the parties\r\ninvolved whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAs a banker, I understand transferring such a huge amount directly from\r\nbank to bank will lead to paying huge fees as a result of international\r\nbanking regulation before receiving the funds over there in your country.\r\nHence, for us to avoid this as impediment, I will bring this idea of the\r\nfund being released via an ATM card which will be sent to your address. The\r\nprocess bears no hindrance from the authority as it will be a very direct\r\nrelease process with no impediment.\r\n\r\nImmediately you receive the ATM card, you will start making withdrawals\r\nfrom it before my arrival to meet with you. I would like us to reach an\r\nagreement before we proceed further.\r\n\r\nkindly send to me your full information such as:\r\nyour full name\r\nyour address\r\ntelephone number\r\ncopy of any identification of you\r\n\r\nAs soon as I receive the above information from you, I will then draft an\r\nMOU agreement which will contain each persons share for both of us to sign\r\nbefore we complete the fund release process through an ATM card.\r\n\r\nI can assure you that whatever questions you would need to ask or any other\r\nthing you will need to know regarding this transaction will be adequately\r\nanswered to give you a clearer understanding of it all, so as to arrive at\r\na successful conclusion.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this transaction, we shall divide the amount in a 50-50 share\r\nratio of which I plan to invest a good part of my share in your country\r\nunder your supervision. All I require from you is your maximum cooperation.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you. Do call or send me a message on my\nwhatsApp for further clarification: +855967405973\r\n\r\nThanks and have a nice day,\r\nThom Chann"

I must admit, I'm not very familiar with banking procedures and regulations, but your plan seems to be well thought out.\n\nI do have a few questions though. Could you please explain more about this 'suspense account'? How does it work exactly? And why is the head office not aware of this money?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by 'stand as the original depositor of the money'? What would that entail on my part?\n\nRegarding the ATM card process, how secure is it? And how would I go about making withdrawals from it?\n\nLastly, I'm curious about the MOU agreement. What exactly will it contain and how binding is it legally?\n\nI look forward to your answers to these questions so that I can better understand this whole process.\n\nBest wishes,\nKerry"

The ATM card comes with a special higher than normal\r\nwithdrawal limit which allows you to withdraw big amounts. This ATM card\r\nwill be linked to a special online account which upon activation will grant\r\nyou access for online transfer usage which also solves our problem of huge\r\nmoney transfers.\r\nkindly send to me your full information such as:\r\n\r\nyour full name\r\nyour address\r\ntelephone number\r\ncopy of any identification of you\r\n\r\nThe said funds do not come under the control of the government at the\r\nmoment within which your bank operates. We can rightly lay claim to the\r\nfund as it is eligible for redistribution. I assure you the bank will not\r\nask you any questions or documents because I have all the documents\r\nrelating to this transaction. I have all the documents relating to this\r\nfund deposited with the bank. I am a PEACE-loving, HONEST and simple man.\r\n\r\nI assure that if we join hands together trusting each other's judgement,\r\nthis transaction will be successful.\r\n\nThanks and have a nice day,\r\nThom Chann"
