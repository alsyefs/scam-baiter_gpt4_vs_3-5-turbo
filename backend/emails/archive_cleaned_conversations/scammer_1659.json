        "body": "  Greetings\n  How do you do? I previously contacted you with my company email (\nsonangolep@mail.ee\n ) and I must commend your swift response and your attention has already made the business project a success. This is my work email, kindly feel free to communicate with me via this email. I work for Sonangol EP Oil and Gas, as the assistant director, licensing and marketing department based here in London, United Kingdom.\n \nWith all due respect, my reason for making this contact with you is that, using the influence of my current official position in Sonangol EP Oil and Gas, I intend to facilitate the immediate transfer of a crude oil lifting license No: COA/6490-100/**** which was formerly operated by your national. And you have been selected as the new operator(Entitled Owner to some Barrels of Crude Oil) because you share the same last name.  Reason behind this is, Mr Allen was deceased some months ago due to the Covid-19 and the crude oil lifting license still has a validity of (3) Three Years remaining till expiration in June of 2027.This license will be transferred to you as the legal grantee and the lifting license will give you/us the legal authority to become crude oil sales agents for Sonangol EP, thereby giving us the opportunity to start earning substantial monthly proceeds as commissions.\n \nMy obligation in this proposed partnership is to continuously ensure that the quantity of crude oil/Gas allocated to you as the licensee beneficiary is sold at market value while your obligation as the licensee is to receive accruing monthly commissions from sales. The referenced license number has a monthly allocation of (1) One Million Barrels for the next (3) 3 Years which means we will have a guaranteed sale capacity of 1 Million Barrels per month.\n \nESTIMATED MONTHLY EARNINGS:\nI will ensure a USD$2.00 discount applies from the local Petroleum Agency [Sonangol EP] which translates to USD$2 Million monthly and also a USD$2 commission from the buyer as well. This amounts to a total guaranteed monthly income of USD$4Million to our partnership per month for the next three years.\nREASON TO CONTACT YOU:\nAs a staff of Sonangol EP, I am not officially allowed to own/operate a crude oil lifting license while employed within the agency, this is to avoid a conflict of interests. This is why I humbly seek to partner with you to become the license owner/operator, while I use my position/network within the organization to assist our partnership and ensure your license application is approved with a guaranteed flow of sales activities of the crude oil which is the toughest part of operating a sales license.\n I propose that we split the proceeds from these sales on a balanced and equity basis of 50:50 apiece. I believe that this is a very fair deal as both of us will be assured of a minimum income of USD$2Million at the end of the monthly sales cycle for the next (3) Years at the minimum.\n \nI assure you that I have made this proposal to you today in the utmost sincerity of purpose and intention, and I naturally expect some amount of discretion as you may come to deal with sensitive or confidential business documents and information in our subsequent correspondence. I am willing to provide further details as you may require and answer any questions you may have in regards to this proposal. Kindly treat your response to this proposal as a matter of urgency as time is of the essence in this matter. I hope to read from you soon.\nRegards,\nChristopher Lee   "

However, I have a few questions that I hope you could help me understand better.\n\nFirstly, how did you come across my name and why was I specifically chosen for this? Also, could you please explain more about the crude oil lifting license? What exactly does it entail and what would be my responsibilities as the licensee?\n\nI'm also curious about the sales process. How does it work and who would be our potential buyers? And lastly, could you provide more information on how the proceeds from these sales are calculated?\n\nI appreciate your patience in answering these questions. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJerry"

        "body": "Hello,\r\n Thank you for the swift response. Let me elaborate more about this project, it's 100% legit and your attention is required because this is a very huge business venture that requires some of your time as we are going to work together and a lawyer will be provided that will represent you in all capacity relating to this business venture.  Our profit originates from the money the buyer pays Sonangol EP for the product after a monthly sales operation is conducted.For example, if the market price per barrel is USD$94.00; as a license operator, Sonangol EP approves the product to you at a discounted value of USD$92.00 and you sell to a buyer at the normal market price of USD$94.00 which means you/we earn a commission of USD$2.00 on every barrel sold from the approved allocation. Regardless of the crude oil market price, our commission remains the same.\r\n I will do everything within my influence to make you understand the intricacies of how this trade works. Our role as the license operator will end once the product is paid for and the responsibility of delivering the oil to the buyer will be handled by the agency. To make this process easier, we shall operate on FOB sales transactions meaning the license owner receives his commission faster without many protocols or risk involved and the required capital is highly moderate. I will use my position to ensure the license is re-assigned to you as the new beneficiary and this will facilitate sales operation swiftly which is the hardest part of the entire procedure.\r\n My obligation in simple terms:\r\n1. Guiding you through the official process of reassigning the Crude oil/Petroleum products sales license.\r\n2. Helping you provide all the legal documents needed for the license reassignment to you as the new beneficiary.\r\n3. Ensuring that your One million barrels’ monthly allocation is sold in a timely manner.\r\n4. Sourcing product buyers that will purchase the monthly allocations.\r\n5. Guiding you step by step through the sales process until the commission is fully paid to your commission receiving account, this will give you an insight into the intricacies of the business.\r\n6. Making available the upfront investment required for the re-assignment process in your favor.\r\n  Your obligation will be:\r\n1.  The signing of a memorandum of understanding between us and a non-disclosure agreement.\r\n2. The signing of the reassignment documentation pack.\r\n3. Acting as the face of the partnership by communicating with our licensing office and the buyer through email and telephone based on my guidelines.\r\n4. Making sure that 50% of the commission is made available to me within 3 to 7 working days of it hitting your nominated commission receiving account.\r\n5. You will open a checking or business account with one of the accredited banks which names I will provide as soon as possible. The account is where our commissions are paid after every monthly sale is concluded and it will be accessible to both partners as equity partners.\r\nTo proceed, I need to be sure you can open a company/DBA or checking account with any good credible banks. Please kindly get back to me as soon as possible. Thanking you in advance for your anticipated cooperation\nRegards,"
