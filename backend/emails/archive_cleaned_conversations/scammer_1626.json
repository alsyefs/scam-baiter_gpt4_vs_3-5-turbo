It appears that Mr. Thomas Edward Cork has presented a power of attorney document claiming to be the rightful beneficiary of the funds in question.\n\nThe power of attorney allegedly states that you, Aaron, have willingly transferred all rights and claims to these funds to Mr. Thomas Edward Cork due to an inability to claim them yourself. However, we have found discrepancies in the document which led us to contact you directly for confirmation.\n\nCould you please confirm if you have any connection or dealings with Mr. Thomas Edward Cork? Also, could you provide more information about any contracts or agreements that might justify this payment?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAaron"
