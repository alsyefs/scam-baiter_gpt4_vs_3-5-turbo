        "body": "Dear Ms. Kristina Georgieva,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding this matter. I must admit, I am a bit confused by the information you have provided. I have never heard of Ms. Donna K. Berliner, and I certainly did not grant her any power of attorney to claim any funds on my behalf.\n\nAs for your question about whether I am dead or alive, I can assure you that I am very much alive and well. It seems there may be some misunderstanding or misinformation going on here.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about this pending fund? How did it come about, and what steps do I need to take in order to receive it? Also, could you clarify the purpose of the code you mentioned?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter and look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nBobbie"
