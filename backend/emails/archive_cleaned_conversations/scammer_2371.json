I am reaching you in regards to an investment I personally intend to do through my bank {United Bank For Africa Group} with your company considering your wealth of experience in this particular field.\nI need your urgent assistance in transferring the sum of Twenty One Million and Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars ($21.5 million Dollars) immediately to any designate account under your care/custody.The fund has been dormant (in-active) for over 10 years in our Bank here (United Bank For Africa Group) without any legal beneficiary coming for it, considering the circumstance that faced the dormant fund without the next of kin.\nI wish to let you know that this fund payment of $21.5 million legally and legitimately belongs to our deceased customer Mr. Andreas Schranner (the owner of the account) who died along with his supposed next of kin in the air crash on 31st July 2000. Ever since that crash incident, nobody has come for the recovery of the fund payment either as a beneficiary or next of kin to the beneficiary.\nAs a clerical account officer then to late Mr .Andreas Scharnner and presently the audit and remittance director to United Bank For Africa Group the bank has assigned me the authority to look for any available next of kin to late Mr. Andrea Schranner who would come over for the collection of the deposited fund urgently, otherwise they will confiscate the funds to the bank treasury. I don't want the fund to go into our Bank treasury as an abandoned fund; this is the reason I am contacting you. I want to front you as the legal next of kin and appointed beneficiary to the fund payment valued $21.5 million Dollars, so that my Bank will release the fund to you as the nearest person to the deceased customer.\nI directly and personally have all the necessary back up documents and other necessary papers to support the successful release of the fund to you without delay provided you agree to work with me and strictly take my professional advice and official directives to actualize the fund to your/our custody. ( I intend to invest my share into any of the businesses that you can advise or your are into).  You can freely visit and browse the website below to have a better understanding of the crash and Mr. Andrea Schranner.\nhttp:/ /news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm\nPlease, I would like you to get back to me if you wish to handle this transaction with me or delete it if you are not interested. Upon receipt of your reply, I will provide you with necessary back up documents and further details to successfully actualize the fund to your custody without any risk involved. I would guard you with my professional advice and direct supervision. I have willingly agreed to share the fund with you in the ratio of 50/50. which is $10 million each. The extra $500,000 has been stipulated for all necessary expenses which we may incur on the course of process and recovering of the fund payment deposit into your nominated account custody.\nBest Regards,\nMr. Steven Albert.

It's not every day that one gets an email about a dormant fund of such magnitude. I must say, it's quite an interesting situation.\n\nHowever, I do have a few questions to better understand this scenario. You mentioned that the original owner of the account, Mr. Andreas Schranner, died in an air crash along with his next of kin. That's very unfortunate indeed. How did you come across my contact information as a potential next of kin?\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on what exactly is required from me in this process? You mentioned that there are necessary back up documents and other papers needed for the successful release of the fund. What kind of documents are these?\n\nLastly, you mentioned about sharing the fund in a ratio and investing in businesses. Could you provide more details about this? What kind of businesses are we talking about here?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nGlenn"

        "body": "Dear Glenn,\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, I must thank you greatly for your readiness and willingness to assist me to achieve and accomplish this project/investing this fund deposit valued US$21.5 million. I have single-handedly worked extensively from underground to fix a lot of things officially right with the intention to gain success actualization of this fund payment to your custody without any risk involved.\r\n\r\nTHESE ARE MY NEW RESOLUTION:\r\n\r\n1. Due to difficult restrictions and unfriendly long process and protocols in transferring huge amount of money from Nigeria to foreign countries, I have resolved with the bank to release this fund through International Certified Loaded Visa ATM Card, Which would be loaded with the money, processed and dispatched to your choice destination\r\naddress in Country.\r\n\r\n2. My bank (United Bank For Africa Group) will be officially authorized through my office to process the release of the fund payment and officially/legally procure a United Bank For Africa Group International Certified Visa Card ATM where the US$21.5 Million will be loaded into. Once this is completed successfully, the fund loaded ATM card together with all the original hard copy transaction documents will be dispatched to your destination choice address in your Country.\r\n\r\n3. When you receive the United Bank For Africa Group fund loaded ATM card, you shall confirm the authenticity and credibility of the United Bank For Africa Group internationally certified ATM card and you will be also to take the ATM card to any available Automated Teller Machine ATM to make a text withdrawal of some cash from the ATM card, this will give you personal confirm of its authenticity, credibility and validity, before the final activation of the ATM card will be carried out by the United Bank For Africa Group which will finally allow you access to huge cash withdrawals from your ATM card account.\r\n\r\n4. To boast your confidence on this transaction and equally put off your fear/doubt on the credibility of this fund payment deposit. I will personally take it upon myself to cover most of the bills/charges towards the documentations, procurement and processing the release of the fund payment.\r\n\r\n5. To clear the doubt and make our agreement standing, I hereby state my rule and the type of expenses I can directly cover towards the actualization of the transaction successfully: (A). I will pay for insurance charges, (B). I will pay for the all affidavit charges, (C). I will cover the charges and pay for prove of ownership certificate (D) I will pay for all necessary documentation and all supportive transaction papers/documents. (E). I will cover the cost/fee of anti-drug certificate, (F) I will pay for the fees on Anti-terrorist clearance certificates, (G) I will pay for the procurement of the United Bank For Africa Group international certified visa card ATM, (H). I will personally pay fees and charges for the loading of the fund $21.5000, 000 into the international visa card ATM which will be posted to your destination address.\r\n\r\n6. Once all these steps/processes are officially, legally and successfully concluded I (Mr. Steven Albert), with the fund deposit US$21.5 million loaded into the United Bank For Africa Group visa card ATM together with all the original hard copy documents ready for dispatch delivery to your address, (DONâ€™T SEND ME MONEY, RATHER) you shall make provision of your DHL/UPS account to dispatch the ATM card/documents to your destination address. This is with view to stop your fear/doubt on the authenticity of this fund payment. I implore your honest and sincere assistance in whatever way you can to see success actualization of this fund payment, because both of us will immensely benefit from the business.\r\n\r\n9. ON THIS NOTE: You will be expected to pay to United Bank For Africa Group (the ATM issuing bank) the ACTIVATION COST ONLY, when you must have received the fund loaded ATM card to your address and confirm it duly ok, by making a TEXT CASH WITHDRAWAL from any available ATM machine nearest to you. The activation will allow connection of your visa ATM card with your account deposit in United Bank For Africa Group to give you free access to huge cash withdrawals from the ATM VISA CARD. Remember the activation fee will be paid ONLY when all process, protocols, packaging and dispatch delivery of the fund loaded ATM card is delivered to your address and you make every necessary INVESTIGATION and proper VERIFICATION to confirm the validity and credibility of the fund payment ATM card. Furthermore you will be allowed to make Text Cash withdrawals with the United Bank For Africa Group Visa Card ATM from available Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to confirm that the fund payment is actually loaded into the ATM Card.\r\n\r\nOnce you verify and confirm this duly OK, then you will directly to talk with the bank as the legitimate appointed next of kin and legal beneficiary to the fund payment deposit valued US$21.5 Million via late Mr. Andreas Schranner (the original owner of the account) who died on air crash since 31st July 2000. Please remember the activation charge/fee will be send to the issuing bank (United Bank For Africa Group) as payment cost to connect your United Bank For Africa Group fund loaded ATM visa card with your account for onward access to huge cash withdrawals.\r\n\r\nThis is my resolution, which I believe will go on well with you. With this detail explanation, there is no hidden agenda whatsoever. I am legitimate and straight forward person who has a name and carrier to protect. Please digest this explanation/clarification very well and get back to me, if you are ready and willing to handle this transaction and conclude the investment with me, I will appreciate it so much.\r\n\r\nView attached, the Deposit certificate, Death certificate and my working id for proper identification.\r\n\r\nI shall also submit the Deposit Certificate and the Death Certificate to my bank on your behalf as your account officer which my bank shall also contact you in respect of that.\r\n\r\nKindly forward to me your full contact information for documentations.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMr. Steven Albert."
