        "body": "Hello Dr. Daniel,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your concern about my understanding of cashier's checks and ATM cards. I would like to learn more about the benefits of using a cashier's check compared to an ATM card. Could you please explain further?\n\nAlso, I'm curious to know why you mentioned closing your office and going home. Is there something specific that prompted this decision?\n\nBest wishes,\nAllan"
