        "body": "Greetings Alan,\r\n\r\nThank you for your mail?  From the turn of your letter to me I discovered\r\nthat you didn't receive letter which I sent to you few days ago,  I am\r\nre-sending my message to you which I sent to you 7 days ago, with due\r\nrespect, I am Barrister Kwami Emmanuel Kpondzo, A legal adviser /financial\r\nconsultant to the late Mr. George, who worked here in Lome-Togo in West\r\nAfrica as a contractor. He died few years ago as a result of a ghastly\r\naccident here in Togo and since then his bank account has been dormant\r\nwithout a claim, recently the management of his bank called and issued me a\r\none-month ultimatum to provide his relative that can stand as his\r\nbeneficiary /next of kin to claim his sum of Nine million six hundred\r\nthousand United State dollars ($9.6 million USD) or they will have the fund\r\nconfiscated into their government treasury as unclaimed fund. As the legal\r\nadviser /financial consultant to late Mr. George, I seek your honest\r\nCo-operation to present you to the bank based on your similarity of country\r\nand family name with him, to act as his relative /next of kin, in order to\r\nascertain approval and release of his balance of ($9.6 million USD) as it\r\nwas stipulated in banks and allied matters of the federal republic of Togo,\r\nso as not to allow the bank confiscate the fund as unclaimed. I will be\r\nhonored to have you here in Lome-Togo as to present you to the bank in\r\nperson to facilitate all the processes and also to make every step appear\r\nclear and transparent to you and to everyone, But if you can't come to Togo\r\nthen I will have to apply formally to the bank on your behalf so that they\r\ncan process the application for the release and transfer of the deposited\r\nfunds to you because the money will be deposited in your personal account\r\nas the bonafide beneficiary /next of kin to the deceased then after which\r\nwe can discuss how and what ratio to share the money.\r\n\r\nFurther information shall be relayed to you upon your positive response.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nBarrister Kwami Emmanuel Kpondzo Esq\r\nSolicitors & Advocates / Principal Attorney Kpondzo & Co.

The situation you described regarding the late Mr. George sounds quite unfortunate.\n\nI must admit, I am not familiar with banking procedures and legal matters, so I have a few questions. Firstly, could you please provide more details about the bank and its requirements for claiming the funds? It would be helpful to understand the process better.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned that if I am unable to come to Togo, you can apply formally on my behalf. How does that work? What information would you need from me in order to proceed with the application?\n\nLastly, once the funds are released, as you mentioned we can discuss how to share them. Could you please elaborate on what ratio or arrangement is typically made in such cases?\n\nThank you again for contacting me and providing this opportunity. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAlan"

        "body": "Greetings Alan,\r\n\r\nThank you for your mail, Alan, I want you to know that it was not by\r\nmistake that I contacted you, I did because I was left with no other option\r\nthan this. Firstly, I would like to notify you that I am soliciting for\r\nyour total assistance and co-operation to enable the bank to release the\r\nsum of (US$9.6 Million) balance of my Late client, to your account. This\r\ntransaction is guided under the Parliamentary ACTS and Inheritance By-Laws\r\nof this country as enacted on the 18th of October 1992 under the\r\nsupervision of the house of parliament. The transaction is therefore 100%\r\nlegal without any risks at all, in as much as we followed the laid down\r\nprocedures as enacted by law.\r\n\r\nAlan, I would also like to bring to your notice that although I have\r\ncontacted you based on a name similarity and basis. Such a basis for\r\ninheritance claims as enshrined in the national allied banking matters act\r\nof Republic of Togo 1990 as amended in 1996 ,qualifies you for outright\r\nparticipation in the claim's payment procedure as far as I can back you up\r\nwith legal court paperwork. So, bear it in mind that it is for the mutual\r\nbenefit of our both families and that is where I stand. Once again,I thank\r\nyou for your time and concern. Basically, what we are supposed to do now is\r\nfor the two of us to cooperate and get the money from the bank. They are\r\nwilling to pay as long as the process remains legal.\r\n\r\nThis business/transaction will be handled legitimately conforming to all\r\nacceptable international standards, let is be mentioned for the sake of\r\nrecords that this our mutual benefit transaction is absolutely legitimate\r\nas all the necessary documents that will be needed in a transaction of this\r\nnature and volume of funds will be issued and obtained in your name and\r\nfavour as the bona fide beneficiary/next of kin.\r\n\r\nAlan, my duty as a lawyer is to serve my clients and provide them with\r\nbackground coverage of the laws and governing acts and edicts both\r\nparliamentary acts and by-laws or notary publications. So I provide all\r\nlegal services covering financial trading and protective stock brokerage\r\nwithin the frames of the modus operandi of the National Allied banking and\r\nfinancial matters acts of this country. Also a bit of International Law but\r\nI am more of an advocate and representative within the jurisdictional\r\nentity of the Customary and Federal High Courts.I am your lawyer in this\r\nclaim and it is one of my duties to protect you from any action that will\r\nnot favour the two of us because we stand for one thing together and that\r\nis the motive to receive the fund.\r\n\r\nAs well it is very important that you note here that what you are doing is\r\nan international bank transaction which involves cash and I mean huge sum.\r\nBanks these days are mandated by laws to forward or record any transaction\r\nthat involves a certain amount of money moving out of the country. Most of\r\nthese laws exist in every country. So if you understand this fact which is\r\nalso operational even in the United States, as certain amounts of money\r\ninvolved in transactions are reported for verification and sources of the\r\nmoney, then if you understand this, you will be able to grasp what I am\r\nabout to explain to you now. I do not respond to your mail from my own\r\npoints of view, I rather base it on facts obtainable both in the banking\r\nindustry here and around the world as well as all legal methods necessary\r\nfor our case.\r\n\r\nNow first and foremost, I want you to realize that everyday funds are being\r\ntransferred in and out of a country, based on the amounts involved, some\r\nfunds may even pass through the office of the presidency before being\r\napproved for transfer to an individual or organization. This is not\r\nsomething strange or new, it is a daily banking activity. The laws have\r\nbeen there and they guide banking activities. So understand this issue,\r\n what we are doing is an inheritance claim and normally as stipulated by\r\nthe Allied banking matters act and in compliance with the same\r\nconstitutional provisions, Inheritance issues in Lome Togo are dealt with\r\nby the Probate Registry, which is a division of the High Court. Its\r\njurisdiction extends to all property of the deceased situated in Lome Togo\r\nas at the date of his/her death. In a case of death by intestacy as ours\r\nis, the court will require his lawyer or a qualified practitioner in the\r\nrelevant jurisdiction to introduce his supposed next of kin who will be\r\napproved normally by affidavits of fact issued by the Inland Revenue\r\nCommissioner to inherit the funds. This is where I will come in and submit\r\nyour information. All requirements in this transaction are applicable by\r\nlaw. The bank is legally supported by the Inheritance constitution in\r\ndemand for certain Court documents from you as backup evidence of your\r\nclaims for the fund payment. These documents are evidential and provisional\r\nWrits of the Court which authenticates your claims and legally empowers you\r\nwith rights over the ownership of the funds with BSIC Lomé-Togo. The\r\ndocuments vary from bank to bank. A bank may demand for documents according\r\nto its operational guidelines and another can demand according to banking\r\nlaws, if we procure and tender legal documents which will bear your name\r\nofficially, and legally certify you as the bonafide beneficiary, there is\r\nno agency or authority in the world that can question you at all. You can\r\nnever face any problem for an inherited money with your government as the\r\ncourt documents will be coming with, A COURT WRIT OF MANDAMUS (AN OFFICIAL\r\nORDER FROM THE COURT TO A LOWER AUTHORITY OR ORGANIZATION TO CARRY OUT AN\r\nACTION. A WRITTEN PROOF FROM A COMPETENT COURT OF JURISDICTION, STATING\r\nTHAT ONE HAS THE TRUE INTENT OF CARRYING OUT ANY ACT AS FAR AS IT IS LAW\r\nABIDING) SO NO AUTHORITY OR ORGANIZATION HAS RIGHT TO QUESTION COURT ORDER,\r\nAll authorities both here and in your country cannot in any way issue a\r\nquery to you, So it is very important that you follow every lay down\r\ndirectives.\r\n\r\nJust a tip-: Inheritance issues in Lome Togo are dealt with by the Probate\r\nRegistry, which is a division of the High Court. Its jurisdiction extends\r\nto all property of the deceased situated in Lome Togo as at the date of\r\nhis/her death. In a case of death by intestacy as ours is, the court will\r\nrequire his lawyer or a qualified practitioner in the relevant jurisdiction\r\nto introduce his supposed next of kin who will be approved normally by\r\naffidavits of fact issued by the Inland Revenue Commissioner to inherit the\r\nfunds. This is where I will come in and submit your information.\r\n\r\nPlease understand this, if the dead person, Late Mr. George , has no WILL\r\nand testament, the estate is dealt with according to the rules of\r\nintestacy'. These set out exactly who is entitled to what, starting with\r\nanybody (or civil partner). If someone dies intestate they have died\r\nwithout leaving instructions about who should receive their property, many\r\npeople die intestate because they thought they were too young to make a\r\nWILL, if a person dies intestate, the sole executors decides how the money\r\nis shared out among the families.\r\n\r\nIn your case, Late Mr. George, died intestate without leaving WILL\r\ninstructions about who should receive his property, so this gives you the\r\nauthority to deal with the estate - collecting in all the deceased's\r\nassets, paying off any debts and tax liabilities, and ultimately\r\ndistributing the assets to yourself and any other beneficiaries according\r\nto the rules of intestacy.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that it is up to the executors or administrators to ensure\r\nthat you each get what you are entitled to under the terms of the 'rules of\r\nintestacy'. In addition, any reliable succession has a right in the\r\ndeceased property if the man dies intestate.  So I will like to clarify\r\nthis and make it known to you outright that I am the sole executor to the\r\nfunds and I was privy to all his financial dealings with the bank, hence I\r\nhave been mandated by the bank to present an heir, having been demanding\r\nfor this for over two years plus and since the bank has given me a mandate\r\nto present an heir, within the next 21 days as stipulated by law, I am here\r\npresenting you with this golden opportunity. I alone have the right to tell\r\nthe bank and every concerned authority that you are the legal beneficiary.\r\nIt's my duty and not yours. Your duty is to lay claim to the fund and my\r\nduty is to back your claims up.\r\n\r\nAlan, you need to know what is required of us now to get your name\r\ncertified and approved as the next of kin and beneficiary to the fund, we\r\nshall provide court inheritance documents in your name, These documents can\r\nonly be procured at the Ministry of Justice in the High Court of Togo.\r\nThose are very delicate and important court documents. The documents are\r\nofficially needed to exhibit the act ( section 2- sub-section 94) of the\r\nfinancial and allied matters of 1993 of this great institute, and to enable\r\nthe payee bank to ensure that the estate of my late client is transferred\r\nto the authorized beneficiary. Alan, you have to produce a court backing\r\nfor such claims and without which you even have no claims at all because\r\nthe Court is the Highest Arm of Authority here and the decisions of the\r\nCourt is not questioned; I am certain of the documents in your name as your\r\nlawyer is my duty to back you up in the court. Banks prefer to work with\r\nlegal clients because they believe that the Court will not send a criminal\r\nto them. So if the Court grants you the documents and you send them to the\r\nbank, my dear you will hug me and congratulate me for this success.\r\n\r\nSo, there will be about 3 or 4 court inheritance documents which we will\r\nprocure in your name, very important, there is never anywhere in the world\r\ngovernment can issue you such power of documents to claim US$9.6 Million\r\nwithout you paying the stamp duty fees, registration fee and Tax/VAT on\r\nthose documents, so this is normal inheritance procedure to prove the\r\nsource of the fund, the United States and world against funding for\r\nterrorism and so many embargoes that are placed daily. I know you are a\r\nmature adult, well educated. So I expect you to understand this. Honestly,\r\nI will tell you the trust the way it's, we need to obtain and register your\r\nname with a court inheritance document, so those documents are not for free.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I will be honored to have you here in Lome-Togo as to present you\r\nto the bank in person to facilitate all the processes and also to make\r\nevery step appear clear and transparent to you and to everyone to enable\r\nyou witness the whole process and watch us move step by step to achieve the\r\nsuccess of this fund transfer, But if you can't come to Togo then I will\r\nhave to apply formally to the bank on your behalf so that they can process\r\nthe application for the release and transfer of the deposited funds to you\r\nas the bonafide beneficiary /next of kin to the deceased then after which\r\nwe can discuss how and what ratio to share the money.\r\n\r\nI will announce the beneficiary to the Late Mr. George estate, we need a\r\nLetter of Administration in your name and information from Lome High Court,\r\nLetters of Administration in probate are the documents that allow the\r\nnecessary legal processes to start. Probate refers to the practice of\r\nadministering an estate after someone dies; if the deceased person did not\r\nhave a Will, probate cannot begin without court approval. This approval is\r\ngranted in the form of a Letter of Administration.\r\n\r\nLetter of administration is the legal authority by the probate Court to a\r\nperson called the administrator or administratrix to administer the estate\r\nor property of a person who died intestate. A person is said to have died\r\nintestate when he dies without leaving behind a valid will. The\r\nadministrator derives his or her authority to act from the terms of the\r\nletter of administration, and where the letter of administration is not\r\ngranted, an administrator lacks the authority to act. It is instructive to\r\nnote that while a probate merely confirms the authority of an executor, a\r\nletter of administration confers authority on an administrator.\r\n\r\nSo, customarily, the person granted the letter of administration is called\r\nadministrator or administratrix  if female. So the Letters of\r\nAdministration are the first step within the probate process. Without this\r\ndocument, you will likely be unable to conduct all of the tasks necessary\r\nto move through probate and ultimately settle an Estate. So please, you\r\nneed to come down here.\r\n\r\n1. Seven days Tourist Visa will be issued to you at the port of entry here\r\nin Lomé–Tokoin Airport, also known as Gnassingbé Eyadéma International\r\nAirport Lome Togo. You will be issued with a 7 days tourist Visa on\r\narrival. While your stay here will not take more than 3 working days as\r\nsuch you are advised to schedule your flight booking to tally with a 3 days\r\nreturn ticket to enable you to face business appointments you might have\r\nback home. You will be guided and assisted on Visa processing upon your\r\narrival because I will make contact with a customs officer who will stamp\r\nyou in at the port of entry.\r\n\r\n2. I will need a complete flight schedule ticket which will indicate your\r\narrival date and time to enable me to be at the airport and pick you on\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n3. You need to make a hotel reservation before your departure from your\r\ncountry. It is a mandatory requirement for issuance of a tourist Visa at\r\nthe point of arrival. I will reach you with the most suitable hotel name\r\nand location to enable you to make such a reservation once I have your\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n4. I must formally apply to the bank on your behalf presenting you to the\r\nbank as the next of kin to my late client, since the bank has given me a\r\nmandate to present an heir, within the next 21 days as stipulated by law,\r\nso I need to register your name and information with the bank before your\r\narrival and to enable me find out the requirements and documents to\r\nprocured from the Lome jurisdictional Federal high court in your name.\r\n\r\nTo apply formally and fill the claim application form at the bank on your\r\nbehalf you are required to confirm the following information:\r\n\r\nFIRST NAME:\r\nLAST NAME:\r\nADDRESS:\r\nCOUNTRY:\r\nNATIONALITY:\r\nOCCUPATION:\r\nMARITAL STATUS:\r\nAGE:\r\nTELEPHONE/WHATS-APP No:\r\n\r\nI propose that the sharing mode of the funds will be as follows: 45% to you\r\nfor your part in this transaction for standing as the next of kin to my\r\ndeceased client, and 45% for me, while the remaining 10% will be Alanated\r\nto the Charity homes around the world. But if you feel otherwise, do not\r\nhesitate to notify me. I have taken time to explain the process for you to\r\nunderstand there is no atom of risk involved in this transaction. My major\r\nconcern is that you in return should not double-cross me at the conclusion\r\nof this transaction.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this transaction requires utmost trust, sincerity and\r\nconfidentiality for its conclusion. You can call or add me on whats-app on\r\nthis number +22899285661 for more information.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nBarrister Kwami Emmanuel Kpondzo Esq\r\nSolicitors & Advocates / Principal Attorney Kpondzo & Co.
