It's good to know that the FBI and the monetary fund have reached an agreement to ensure that I receive my money without any additional costs.\n\nI understand that the payment will be made through an ATM smart card, which seems like a convenient way to transfer a large amount of money.

Specifically, I would like to know how I can obtain the ATM smart card and what steps I need to take to activate it.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned a delivery fee for the ATM smart card.
