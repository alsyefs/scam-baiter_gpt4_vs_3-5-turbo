        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. It's really interesting to hear about the process involved in releasing funds. I must admit, I'm not very familiar with these procedures, so it's quite enlightening.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about this FUND RELEASE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT? What exactly is it and why is it so important for the fund release?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"the fund was painted RED\"? Is that some sort of financial terminology?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but as I mentioned earlier, I'm not very well-versed in these matters. Your patience and assistance are greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nEstelle"
