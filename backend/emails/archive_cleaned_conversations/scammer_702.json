        "body": "Dear Marilyn\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI received your email and I want to assure you that this is a high profile\r\nbusiness and will be very successful and has no illegal implications\r\nwhatsoever as everything for the successful completion is well arranged and\r\nthere is no risk involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think you should have a brief knowledge about the source of the funds.\r\nProbably the history of fund origin will help you make an informed decision\r\nand know exactly how you could handle the deal should you make up your mind\r\nto be part of the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would further like to introduce myself to you first before we proceed. My\r\nname is Ernest Francis Groth. I was a financial Expert & Consultant and\r\nworked with Hill House Capital Group, an Asia-based investment management\r\nfirm founded by Zhang Lei in 2005 with US$20 million in seed capital from\r\nthe Yale Endowment. Hill House has offices in New York, Beijing, Hong Kong\r\nand Singapore. It invests globally, with a particular focus on Asia, (Hill\r\nHouse Capital Group) with its Subsidiaries: Care Capital Advisors, HHGL 360\r\nBuy Holdings, Ltd.\r\n\r\nThe origin of this fund is from an “over invoice” sale of Petroleum\r\nproducts that amounted to $820 million USD and was moved from Hong Kong to\r\nBarclays Bank Plc Private volt for safe keeping, after which I later\r\nretired from the company and started running my own private business.\r\n\r\n I was able to secure these funds while I was working with Hill House\r\nCapital Group as we are mainly Hedge Fund, Private Equity, Venture Capital.\r\nI am the only person aware of this funds now as my other partner who was\r\naware died of covid-19 related complications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the funds have been moved to an offshore bank in Dubai, United Arab\r\nEmirates and placed in an Escrow Account as third party beneficiary funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis third party is assumed to be the supplier of petroleum products to my\r\nprevious company for which the invoice was raised to be paid. Now it is due\r\nfor the funds to be released by the bank according to the terms of deposit,\r\nand I am ready to present you to the bank as the beneficiary of the funds.\r\n\r\n I believe with your response to my email I can trust you and have this\r\ntransaction done with you. I want to move these funds as investment funds\r\nand I require your full cooperation for the success of the deal.\r\n\r\n I have made a breakthrough on how we can successfully move these funds to\r\nyou without any International monetary agency requesting huge taxes to be\r\npaid upfront before the funds will be transferred to you.\r\n\r\nAll relevant legal documents for a backup of the funds are also available\r\nfrom the bank and all transactions will be done via bank to bank\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n I will be expecting to hear from you and if you have any further\r\nquestions, I am open to answer your questions.\nBest Regards\r\n\r\nErnest Francis Groth"

        "body": "Dear Marilyn\r\n\r\nThanks for your email response. I am retired and I do not have any specific\r\npreferred area of investments. It all depends on what you can offer and\r\nyour area of specialization as well.\r\n\r\nBelow is the process of handing the funds over to you. I await your\r\nfeedback as you carefully go through all of them.\r\n\r\nWe are moving the funds via bank to bank. But there are important things\r\nfor you to know.\r\n\r\n1. I informed you that this fund was made from an \"Over-Invoicing\" from my\r\nprevious company. So the fund was assumed to be a payment meant for a\r\ncustomer of my previous company.\r\n2. In depositing the funds to the bank, it was declared for third party\r\nownership, which means it does not belong to the depositor which is me. I\r\nam only holding the funds in an escrow account in trust for the real owner\r\nwhich is a third party.\r\n3. Now I will introduce you to the bank as the third party owner, with a\r\nletter of authorization to claim the funds from the bank.\r\n4. With the MOU, Proof of Funds, My ID and the letter of authorization, you\r\nwill make a presentation to the bank for the release of the funds.\r\n5. The bank will request for you to first open a non resident online\r\noffshore with them. The money will first be moved from the escrow account\r\ninto your own account that you will open with the bank.\r\n6. Once this process is completed, you can then begin to transfer the funds\r\nto all designated accounts that we may choose and in any country of our\r\nchoice.\r\n7. The only money to be involved in this deal is the money to be used to\r\nopen the account with the bank. Yet once we begin transfer of funds, we can\r\neasily transfer the money back to us.\r\n\r\nPlease kindly study the above procedures very well and if you are ready to\r\njoin me, then let us proceed. If accepted, please kindly let me know so\r\nthat I can send the MOU to you for signing.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nYour faithfully\r\nErnest Francis Groth"

        "body": "Dear Marilyn\r\n\r\nI acknowledge the receipt of your email with thanks.\r\n\r\nFirst as I explained in my previous mail, there will be no need to refer\r\nback to the company where the funds were made. I do not work for the\r\ncompany anymore. Secondly, I clearly stated that the fund was made through\r\n\"over-invoicing\", or what you may call \"contract inflation\". I partnered\r\nwith a colleague because we were in charge of financial disbursements at\r\nour local unit, to increase the amounts to be paid to suppliers and\r\ncontractors, hence a third party is needed who will now be assumed to be\r\nthe \"contractor or supplier\" to my previous company. And this is where you\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the total amount involved as I also stated in my previous email\r\nis Eight Hundred and Twenty Million US Dollars (USD820M).\r\n\r\nThirdly, Non Resident Online Account is an offshore account, to be opened\r\nin your name without your visit or physical travel to the bank. It takes a\r\nprocess. Once we have an agreement to work together, I shall recommend you\r\nto the bankers with a letter of authority and the proof of funds documents.\r\nYour personal data will be needed by the bank. You will also be required to\r\nfill and sign the online account opening forms. An amount of money\r\nrepresenting account opening and activation deposit will be required by the\r\nbank, which we shall contribute jointly to open and activate the account.\r\n\r\nThen once the account is fully activated, the funds of USD820M will be\r\nmoved from the bank's escrow into your non-resident online account. We can\r\nthen begin to transfer the funds bit by bit to your designated account for\r\nfurther disbursements to our investment projects.\r\n\r\nI want to believe you should have full knowledge of the deal after going\r\nthrough my explanations. I therefore wait for your urgent response so that\r\nwe can proceed.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\nErnest Francis Groth"
