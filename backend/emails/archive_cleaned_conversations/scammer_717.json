I am happy to know you. But\r\nAlmighty Lord knows you better and know why he directed me to you at this\r\npoint. To begin i saw your email and contact details on my search for a\r\ngood Next of kin online as a result of my urgency to put my last wish into\r\nreality before i die any time soon.\r\n\r\nI am writing this mail to you with heavy tears In my eyes and great sorrow\r\nin my heart, My Name is Mrs Elizabeth Raymond I am contacting you from my\r\nUSA ALABAMA I want to tell you this because I don't have any other option\r\nthan to tell you as I was touched to open up to you, I am married to Mr.\r\nJörg Raymond Marten who worked with Madrid Spain\r\nembassy As a doctor in Madrid Spain for nine years before he died last two\r\nyears due to Covid19. We were married for eleven years without a child.\r\n\r\nHe died after a brief illness from the corona Virus that lasted for only\r\nTwenty days.  When my late husband was alive, he deposited the sum of\r\n€10,850,000.00 ( Ten million eight hundred and fifty thousand euro ) in a\r\nbank in Switzerland . Presently this money is still in the bank, he made\r\nthis money available for exportation of Gold from Madrid Spain mining\r\nbefore his sudden death. Recently My Doctor told me that I would not last\r\nfor the period of 3 months due to cancer problem again. The one that\r\ndisturbs me most is my stroke illness.

Also make sure that the house of God is\r\nmaintained from the funds. Am doing this so that God will forgive my sins\r\nand accept my soul because I have suffered from this illness so much.

        "body": "Dear ,\r\n\r\nI hope this email finds you in good health and spirits. I am glad to\r\nreceive your response and know that you are willing to embark on this\r\njourney to grant my last wish. Your willingness to help brings me great joy\r\nand comfort during these challenging times due to my health conditions.\r\n\r\nAs you are now aware, the purpose of this transaction is to find a suitable\r\nNext of Kin online to ensure my last wish is fulfilled before my time\r\ncomes. The urgency arises from my current health situation, as I have been\r\nbattling both a stroke and cancer, which has led to my realization of the\r\nimportance of fulfilling this wish without delay.\r\n\r\nNow, let me explain how the transaction is going to work. Many people\r\nassume that their Next of Kin automatically becomes the heir to their\r\naccount. However, that is not the case. Your Next of Kin is not a signatory\r\nto your account, and without a written will to determine their legitimacy,\r\nthey will not have access to the funds in your account. Instead, the bank\r\nwill go through a process called legal probate to determine who will\r\nreceive the money in your account.\r\n\r\nLegal probate is a lengthy and expensive process, and even after completing\r\nit, your family would have to forfeit a significant amount due to legal\r\nfees. To avoid this, we can request the bank for a Payable on Death (POD)\r\ndesignation for the account. This designation will allow the funds to be\r\ndirectly transferred to the designated beneficiary upon the account owner's\r\ndeath, without going through probate.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the POD designation, I have an advantage as the banker working at\r\nthe bank where the funds are held. During my banking days, I formed a close\r\nrelationship with a high-ranking officer in the department that handles\r\nthese matters. With this connection, I can facilitate the process of\r\nobtaining the POD certificate, and all we need to do is present the death\r\ncertificate to access the funds.\r\n\r\nI have attached a copy of my identity card and my late husband's death\r\ncertificate for your reference. Your understanding of this transaction is\r\ncrucial, and your response signifies your seriousness in handling this\r\nmatter. I assure you that if you follow my instructions, we can\r\nsuccessfully obtain the funds without any complications.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your decision, and if you are willing to proceed, I will\r\nsend you the bank details and initiate the process of obtaining the POD\r\ncertificate in your name. We can finalize this transaction within two\r\nworking days from now.\r\n\r\nThank you once again for your willingness to be a part of this\r\nlife-changing experience. Your kindness and assistance mean the world to me\r\nto maintain trust i have attached a copy of my ID and death certificate so\r\ni will need few details from you to kno we are on same part\r\n\r\nFull names\r\nCountry\r\nOccupation\r\nAge\nPhone Number\r\nHome Address\r\nCopy of Driver License or Passport\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nWith warm regards,\r\n\r\nElizabeth Ray."

It's interesting to learn that simply being a Next of Kin does not automatically grant access to the funds. Could you please explain more about how the Payable on Death (POD) process works? How does it ensure that the designated person receives the funds without going through probate?\n\nI also noticed that you mentioned having a close relationship with a banker who can facilitate the process of obtaining the POD. That sounds like it could be helpful. Could you provide more details about this banker and their role in this process?\n\nBefore we proceed further, I would like to know more about how this will work and what my responsibilities would be. Can you please clarify what specific actions or information you need from me? Additionally, could you explain why my personal information such as full name, country, occupation, age, phone number, home address, and copies of identification documents are necessary for this process?\n\nThank you once again for considering me for this important task.
