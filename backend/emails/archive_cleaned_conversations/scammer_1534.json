Hence i am contacting you with\nthis as i have lost confidence in them because it is obvious they are\nnot contended With what i have left for them.\nthe last of my funds which no one knows of is a cash deposit of(Twenty\nfive million four hundred thousand united states dollars)\n($25.4,000,000,00) stashed in one trunk boxes and declared as personal\neffects of high security value which i have with a Bank. all i am\nasking of you is to assist me in making the collection of this deposit\nand dispatching the funds for development of the church and any\ncharity organizations of your choice, after keeping 20% of the funds\nfor yourself and your family.\nPlease contact me as soon as you get this email if you are capable and\nsincere to handle this project! Section on my behalf so i can forward\nyou with all relevant documents necessary for the claims and the name\nof the firm where the funds are deposited.\ngod bless you as i await words from you. please inform as soon as\npossible if you are not interested so i can proceed to seek for\nsomeone else to carry out this on my behalf. find attached my\nInternational Passport my picture on my hospital bed along with this\nemail for your verification.\nMy address Address in Mexico,  Finisterra #2315-1, Fracc.

        "body": "Hello Raschid Aun Nafarrate,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm sorry to hear about your health condition and the challenges you're facing. It's indeed a noble thought to want to give back to society in such a significant way.\n\nYour story is quite touching, and it's clear that you've had a change of heart regarding how you view life and wealth. It's never too late to make amends and do good in the world.\n\nHowever, I must admit that I'm not sure if I'm the right person for this task. Handling such a large amount of money is a huge responsibility, and I wouldn't want anything to go wrong.\n\nCould you perhaps provide more information on how this process would work? What steps would need to be taken? And how can we ensure that everything is done legally and ethically?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTerri"
