This is the only information required in order to transfer the deceased estate to you.\r\n\r\nBut before we move forward, I need you to be aware of the formalities required in order for the court to certify and affirm the transfer of possession to you. Please be guided, in executing an estate there is a standard requirement. Executing an estate requires certain legal formalities to validate the likelihood of testament. These steps are designed to ensure the capacity, intent and authenticity of the documents purporting to be legally certified.\r\n\r\nAs communicated, there is some legal paperwork that you will be compelled to obtain in order to certify and affirm to the transfer of possession to you under the court jurisdiction; such as Change of Ownership (Title transfer and Property Mutation), Affidavit of Domicile, Succession Certificate, Statutory Declaration, and Affidavit of Death and Heirship to legally certify the process. All these documents will be presented to the deceased bank in order to release the deceased funds to you.\r\n\r\nThese documents will be executed and affirmed under the court jurisdiction. Please be informed, in order to obtain the stipulated paperwork for this matter, the process of procurement will cost a small amount of money which I would like to inform you of before we move forward in approaching the court for the acquisition and transition of documents. Please be aware, to obtain the documents stipulated, the process of procurement will cost you the sum of US$375 which is very important for you to take cognizant of before we take further actions. You’re expected to bear the cost incurred in procuring the legal documents as to be given possession to the deceased estate. We are obliged to execute the process in accordance with the provision of the law of the state.\r\n\r\nPlease be advised, in order to have the deceased financial institution release the deceased Estate Funds to you, you will be required to provide these stipulated listed documents in order to validly certify the instruments so as to enable the bank to proceed with the directives from the court in processing/remitting the deceased funds to you Payable on Death Account. Without these documents, we won’t be granted access to the decedent estate. I look forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMark Schaeber\r\n\r\nTel: (315) 869-5602."

        "body": "Dear Mark,\n\nThank you for your detailed explanation. I appreciate the time you took to clarify these terms for me. It's all starting to make more sense now.\n\nI'm curious about the property mutation process. How long does it usually take? And are there any specific documents that need to be prepared in advance?\n\nAs for the payment method, a direct bank transfer sounds fine to me. However, could you please explain how this process works? I've never done a bank transfer before and would like to understand it better.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJessica"
