It's great to hear that the current government has approved my payment.\n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts of your message though. Could you please clarify what you mean by \"secure the needed here\"? Also, could you explain more about this waiver? What exactly does it entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
