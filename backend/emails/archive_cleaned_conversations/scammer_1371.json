Many fund beneficiaries have gone through hell in the hands of those satanic executives without having anything to show despite all their efforts. The decision to assist you was born out of my Christian background and also to put a stop to those sinister acts. I am communicating to you with my personal email address for the security and safety of the funds.\r\n\r\nMy good friend, I am glad for your determination to protect me, my husband and kids. Based on this I must ensure you receive this ATM card as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAs you know, CBN is highly guarded by security operatives and we the Staffs are searched thoroughly. I will go ahead to pick it out from the place where I kept it inside the bank between tomorrow and next so all I require from you is prayer for God's protection and solid promise to Guide the information.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I pick it out from our office, I will arrange on how to dispatch it to you within 24hours.\r\nI shall get back to you as soon as I am through.\r\n\r\nRemain blessed!\nRegards,\r\nMrs Judith Oduluso.\r\nOffice assistant to the Central Bank Governor."
