        "body": "Hello Jansen Van Vuuren Willem Frederick De La Rey,\n\nIt's been a while indeed! I'm glad to hear that you're doing well in Nicaragua and attending school. That's fantastic news!\n\nI must say, your message has taken me by surprise. I appreciate your kind gesture of wanting to repay the money I lost trying to help you. However, I'm a bit confused about the process you've described.\n\nYou mentioned that you've deposited the sum with the Western Union Agency in Ghana. Could you please explain why it was done this way? Also, how does transferring the money bit by bit work?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarmella"
