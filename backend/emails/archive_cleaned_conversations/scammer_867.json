        "body": "Hello Lela,\n\nThank you for your prompt response and interest in our ATM VISA CARD. The card functions just like any other ATM card. You can use it to withdraw money from any ATM machine worldwide. The reason there is a daily withdrawal limit of US$10,000 is to ensure the security of your funds and prevent fraudulent activities.\n\nThe process is quite simple. Once you pay the processing fee and shipment insurance fee, we will send the card to your address via courier service. Upon receiving the card, you will need to activate it by changing the PIN to a number of your choice.\n\nI hope this clarifies things for you. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\nBest regards,\nDr.\n\nBest wishes,\nLela"
