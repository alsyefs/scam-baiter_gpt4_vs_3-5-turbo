These\r\nDocuments must however, be certified as true reflection of the original\r\ncopies in line with the provisions of the law guiding admissibility of\r\ndocuments. It is therefore on this instance we can only accept a certified\r\ncourt order in the deduction of government taxes, this is what we yield and\r\nseek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can send your attorney or retain the services of one among the\r\naccredited law firms registered with the bank and the commission to\r\nundertake these assignments as you would have under the supervision of our\r\nClaims & Legal Services Dept. vested with the right of oversight functions\r\non them. The law firm is to Process, obtain and submit the requisite order\r\nenabling us to carry out our duties and remit your final balance as due.\r\nYou will be paying for their services being not the responsibility of the\r\ncommission neither government tax.\r\n\r\nThese are just the two cost incidences on this disbursement, the commission\r\ndoes not negotiate attorneyâ€™s fee on behalf of fund owners but fund owners\r\nare guided by the Claims & legal Services Dept. to preventing these law\r\nfirms from taking undue advantage of fund owners.\r\n\r\nYour file is moved to the bank to observe and enforce these accurate Tax\r\nassessment deduction plan. You representative attorney is invited to sign\r\nout all the classified payment warrants i.e. The *AUTHORITY TO REMIT,\r\nCERTIFICATE OF INDEMNITY* and most importantly, your *FUND ORIGIN\r\nCERTIFICATE* which states clearly the purpose of payment and enables you\r\nmove your fund to any part of the globe you wish to invest having been\r\ncleared of any financial infraction harboring no encumbrance.\r\n\r\nThe attorney is to supervise and confirm the remittance of your fund into\r\nyour bank having paid the statutory *SIGNING FEE *mandatory to every fund\r\nowner at the bank marking the conclusion of your disbursement.\r\n\r\nSorry this might be lengthy compressing all your questions but we only have\r\nto explain this by illuminating the scenarios for you to understand the\r\nfacts and sequence of events here as we thus seek your honest counsel in\r\nother to objectify this payout expeditiously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreeting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGORDON RICHARD\r\n\r\nEuropean Credit Commission"
