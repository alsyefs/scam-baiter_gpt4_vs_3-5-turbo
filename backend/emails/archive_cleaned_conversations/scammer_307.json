        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for your detailed explanation about Bitcoin. I must admit, it's a bit of a new concept for me. You mentioned that it's the safest and cheapest way to send money globally, which sounds very appealing.\n\nI'm curious though, how does Bitcoin work exactly? And why is it faster than traditional bank transfers? Also, you mentioned going to a mall or finding a Bitcoin clerk. Could you please elaborate on this process?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDonna"

One\r\nthird of the people in the world knows and uses bitcoin for proper and safe\r\ntransactions. As you said that it is new to you, do as I said before. If\r\nyou are unsure on how to send the money via bitcoin, go to a nearby\r\nsupermarket, they often have helpful staff there that can assist you with\r\ntech-related stuff like this. Just explain your situation to them, and they\r\nwill be able to guide you through the process step by step.If you know you\r\nare not familiar with bitcoin, you can ask for a bank account to where to\r\nsend the money.

You mentioned that a third of the world uses it, which is quite impressive! Could you perhaps explain a bit more about why it's such a popular method of transferring money? \n\nAlso, you mentioned going to a nearby place where they have helpful staff who can assist me with this process. Could you clarify what kind of place you're referring to? Is it like a bank or something different?\n\nLastly, if I were to consider using a bank account instead, how would that process work?
