I am indeed alive and in good health, thank you for your concern.\n\nI must say, your email has taken me by surprise. I wasn't aware of any unpaid payment of Millions Dollar with the Royal Bank Of Asia. Could you please provide more details about this? How did this come about?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the ATM card method? It sounds very convenient but I'm not quite sure how it works. Will the card have my name on it? And how can I use it to access the funds?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDeborah"
