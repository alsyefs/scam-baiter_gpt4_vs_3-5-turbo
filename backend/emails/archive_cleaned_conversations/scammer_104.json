It wasn't any problem\r\nfor them to get the money out here due to their diplomatic immunity. Well,\r\nit is up to you to know if you have any possible options where you can\r\ninvest and manage the money for the family. Such a huge amount of money is\r\nenough to set up any manufacturing company in any part of the world.

There is no specific charity\r\norganization in mind but that will be your responsibility to determine how\r\nyou will distribute the humanitarian service to meet with the family's\r\ndesire. The grace period of 18 months is a period you will be allowed to\r\ntestrun the investment you put the money in. After the grace period of the\r\n18 months, you will then start sharing the investment profit as suggested\r\nby the family.\r\n\r\nCould you please call me on my numbers below, we can talk more on the phone\r\nor WhatsApp call.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you again soon.\nYours Sincerely,\r\nABDULLAH MOHAMMED\r\nPhone: +233 53 040 8143\r\nWhatsApp: +233 53 771 3216"

It's quite an interesting proposition you have there, and I appreciate the trust you're willing to place in me.\n\nI understand the family's concerns about past losses and their desire to be cautious this time around. It's always wise to learn from past experiences.\n\nAs for my capability, I'm certainly interested in exploring this opportunity further, but as you rightly pointed out, it would be best if we could discuss more details about the investment and management of such a large sum of money.\n\nThe idea of meeting face-to-face is appealing as it would allow us to get to know each other better and build mutual trust. However, due to current circumstances, I wonder if we could arrange a virtual meeting instead?\n\nRegarding the profit sharing and charity distribution, these are indeed areas that can be discussed further once we've established a solid understanding of each other's expectations.\n\nLastly, I must apologize but I am unable to make phone calls at the moment. Could we perhaps continue our discussions via email or through a secure online platform?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKelly"

        "body": "Thanks Mr. Kelly,\r\nYour email is well noted. However, it is important to let you know that\r\ntrust in a business partnership of this magnitude cannot only be built by\r\nvirtual means as the family will not believe there is trust in the\r\ndiscussion.  One thing again is your not being able to make a phone call or\r\nWhatsApp call to me looks unhealthy because it costs nothing to do that so\r\nas to be sure you are not talking to a ghost. All this starts to build\r\ntrust and confidence in each other. I feel very much worried to hear that\r\nyou cannot make a call. First meeting will be arranged by conference call\r\nwith you and Dr. Abdallah the family head then we discuss the possible\r\nmeeting with you here in Accra Ghana to seal the deal with signing of the\r\ninvestment agreement. Other than that, the family would consider this a\r\nwaste of our time.\r\n\r\nWell, I will leave that to you to think about it. If you are ready to\r\nproceed with this discussion and possible arrangement for our meeting, I\r\nwill appreciate your final resolution on that.\r\n\r\nI hope to hear from you again soon.\nYours Sincerely,\r\nABDULLAH MOHAMMED\r\nPhone: +233 53 040 8143\r\nWhatsApp: +233 53 771 3216"
