And since\r\nmy husband's death I have been diagnosed with cancer that I hardly move\r\naround.\r\n\r\nRecently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 6 weeks\r\nbecause the cancer has gotten to a very bad stage. When my husband was\r\nalive he made a deposit of $10,5m USD. Knowing my condition I have decided\r\nto donate this money out for charity purposes. Beloved one Carolyn, I want\r\nto hand over this money to you, I want you to use at least 70% of this\r\nmoney to visit the orphanages homes, help the poor, sick ones in the\r\nhospital and woman with cancer then take the remaining amount to take care\r\nof your home because every worker deserves his wages.\r\n\r\nI took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this\r\nmoney, my relatives are not Good, they are selfish, they frustrated my\r\nmarriage life, because of a condition they turned their back on me thinking\r\nnothing good will come out from me since I am SICK AND\r\nCHILDLESS Moreover, my late husband vowed to use our last wealth to help\r\nthe less privileged since we have no child.\r\n\r\nWhoever gives to the poor lends to the lord and the lord will reward him\r\nfor what he has done, pray for my peaceful rest with the lord, when I am\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nThanks and be Blessed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carmen Lora Dima\r\n\r\nTHIS WAS A MESSAGE FROM LORA BEFORE HER DEATH:"
