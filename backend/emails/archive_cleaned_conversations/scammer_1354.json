I wasn't aware that I had any funds with the European Union, let alone a next of kin associated with it.\n\nCould you please provide more details about these funds? How did they come to be in my name? And who is the next of kin that has been mentioned?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
