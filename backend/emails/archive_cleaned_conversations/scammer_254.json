Which we answered few of them on our previous email. This funds was originated by Cambodian government. There is a program that Cambodian government do every year. This program is done once in a year here, by balloting through World Chamber of Commerce (WCC). This means they will go through World Chamber of Commerce and get many names and email and ballot it, any person his or her name and email entered, they will made the person there foreign beneficiary. That is how this fund comes in existence. But why we called it unclaimed funds is because, the formally manager who is in charge to contact you then for this funds, refused to do so, until I entered as a new manager and see your file, then decided to contact you for it  that is where the name unclaimed funds came in.\r\n\r\nAccording to your second question here? You said how long will it take and the process too. It's will take only 48 hours to process, and the process will began once you send the details that we required below for the processing.\r\n\r\nYou are advised here to get back to us with the required details, so that we can start the processing of your Unclaimed funds immediately.\r\n\r\nYour immediate response is needed here.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\nDr. Alhaji Usman\r\nThe Operation Manager\r\nBDO BANK SM City Manila ranch"
