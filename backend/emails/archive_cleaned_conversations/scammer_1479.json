        "body": "  From: Dr. Michael Chima,\nSenate Committee on Foreign Contract Payments.\nRef: FRN/SEN/COMM/CONT/PAYMENTS/-18/24.\nMy Dear Friend,\nCompliments of the day.\nI am The Chairman, Senate Committee on Contract Settlement, few days ago your name and payment file was forwarded to my office as one of the beneficiaries to receive their funds in this quarter payment exercise.\nFrom my personal Investigation, the fund you have been trying to claim for so many years came as a result of Inheritance of an over-invoiced contract payment, although the said fund has already been approved for payment in your name. But due to so many reasons which I cannot mention to you at the moment why the said approved fund has not been released to you.\nIn fact, there are some mistakes/irregularities and illegal approval documents in the past in your payment file which need to be corrected before you will be able to receive this fund without you having any more delay or problem during transfer.\nYou are also aware that some of the government officials and Banks here in Nigeria, even abroad have tried to transfer this fund to you but failed due to their dishonesty, greed, and unnecessary demand for fees. So, you are hereby advised to stop any further communications with anyone else or any other financial institution and comply with this directive as to avoid any further delays.\nAbove are the major reasons why you could not receive this payment up till today and you may likely not to receive it unless you will comply to my advise and conditions below:\n1) You shall keep this transaction very confidential/top secret.\n2) You shall give me a letter of Guarantee to assure me that you will not expose my involvement.\nOnce you agree and comply with me, then be rest assured to receive this fund as soon as possible, but if you refuse to work on my aforementioned stated conditions then I shall  send my report to the Presidency, The Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N), and Economic & Financial Crime Commission (E.F.C.C) for onward cancellation of the payment.\nDear Friend, All I need now is your sincere cooperation for immediate release of the funds to you for our mutual benefit.\nI wait for your positive reply for us to proceed.\nBe advised.\nDr Michael Chima.

        "body": "*Dear Sir,I have received your reply and the contents are well\r\nnoted.However in-order to know me very well, I am sending an attached copy\r\nof my working I.D card for your perusal and record.Before we proceed into\r\nthis transaction I would like to give you a little information about the\r\norigin of this fund and the process to enable you to receive the fund this\r\ntime without any more failure during transfer.(1). Like I said in my\r\nprevious message the said fund came as a result of over invoiced contract\r\ninheritance payment, but one of the reason you couldn't receive your fund\r\nbefore now was due to so many mistakes and fake approvals documents in your\r\npayment file even though the actual fund amount to be transfer to you was\r\nnot the real amount which is a total sum of $15,400,000.00 (Fifteen\r\nMillion, Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only.(2). You are\r\nvery aware that so many officials here and abroad have tried to transfer\r\nthe fund to you but failed due to the mistakes in your payment file even\r\nthough there were unnecessary demands of fees and dishonesty by these\r\nofficials handling the payment for you in the past..But I must also tell\r\nyou that most of these officials were very corrupt, while some of them were\r\nnothing but impostors and scammers who don't have the ideas and connections\r\nto handle this kind of sensitive transaction.(3). If you really want to\r\nreceive this fund, you must give me your full cooperation because I must\r\nfirst of all need to correct the mistakes and fake approval documents in\r\nyour payment file.After my corrections in your file, I am going to get\r\nfresh approvals and authentic clearance documents in your name from\r\nresponsible authorities where the said fund contract was awarded and\r\nexecuted, otherwise NO DEAL and just forget about the fund.(4). Based on my\r\nrecent transactions, the best and safer way for you to receive this kind of\r\ninherited funds is through an ATM Card or Online bank transfer. Anyway, as\r\nwe proceed fully in the transaction I will guide you on the next step to\r\nfollow.In fact, without the above stated process there is no way you can\r\nnever receive the fund successfully because financial Crime Authorities\r\nlike I.M.F etc, will certainly stop the fund transfer if there is no\r\nauthentic approvals and clearance documents covering the fund in your\r\nname.Regarding my safety, you must give me a letter of guarantee to prove\r\nthat you will never betray me when you receive the fund.I am making this\r\nrequest based on the fact that I was recently betrayed by one (Mr Dean\r\nJohnson of United State) after all my help to him to receive his long\r\noverdue funds. And for this reason, I would not like such a thing to happen\r\nto me again.My Dear friend, as long as you can be trusted and ready to\r\nfollow my guidelines, then be rest assured to receive this fund within the\r\nnext 7 working days from today. THIS I CAN BET YOU WITH MY LIFE.But if you\r\ninsist and cannot comply with me, then just forget this fund because I will\r\nhave no other choice than to return the funds back to the Government\r\ncoffers.I look forward to receiving your positive feedback for us to\r\nproceed.Be advised.Dr. Michael Chima*"

You need to give me a letter of guarantee stating that you will not\r\nbetray me when you finally received the funds.\r\n\r\nOnce you send the letter of guarantee duly signed by you I will start to\r\nfix or correct all the mistakes in your file.\r\n\r\nAfter the corrections process a lawyer will need to go to the Court with\r\nyour information to  get Court approval as well to obtain other related\r\nfund clearance documents from responsible authority where the said fund\r\ncontract was awarded and executed.\r\n\r\nLike I mentioned in the same message of yesterday, the best way for you to\r\nreceive the fund is through an ATM card or through online bank transfer.\r\n\r\nWith this, you are going to open an online bank account here where I will\r\nmonitor every process by myself.\r\n\r\nAnd the account must be for this transaction alone so that once the fund\r\ntransfer is complete we shall immediately close the account to avoid any\r\ntrace in the future.\r\n\r\nBut whereby you prefer to receive the fund through an ATM card option then\r\nyou shall take care of the card delivery cost to your address.\r\n\r\nI hope you can understand my explanation clearly.\r\n\r\nI wait for your positive reply so the I can send draft of the letter of\r\nguarantee to you to sign and return back to me.\r\n\nDr. Michael Chima."
