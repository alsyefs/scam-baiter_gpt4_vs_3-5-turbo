        "body": "  HELP IN DISTRIBUTING FUNDS TO THE POOR AND NEEDY\nFrom Mr. TERRY GREEN.\nThis letter may come to you as a surprise, but I have to say that I have no\nintentions of putting you into any form of stress or worries. As you read\nthis, I don't want you to feel sorry for me because I believe everyone will\ndie someday.\nMy name is Mr. TERRY GREEN. a business tycoon based in British Virgin\nIslands. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was\ndiscovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has\ndefiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about just few\nmonths to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived\nmy life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself or my\nfamily but my business.\nThough I am very rich, I was never caring, I was always hostile to people\nand only focus on my business as that was the only thing I ever cared for.\nBut now I regret all this, as I now know that there is more to life than\njust wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe if God\ngives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a\ndifferent way from how I have lived it. Since the announcement of the\ndiagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer and the time I have to stay\non earth, I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want\nthis to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.\nSo far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations here in\nBritish Virgin Islands and also in Indonesia, and some African Countries.\nNow that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any\nmore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts in\nBulgaria and donate the money to charity organization in Bulgaria, they\nconnived and instead kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust\nthem anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for\nthem and others, they stole from me.\nThe last of my money, which is the huge cash deposit that I have with a\nFinancial Firm abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and\ndistribute it to charity organizations in your country and let them know\nthat I Mr. TERRY GREEN.is making this generous donation. I am writing this\nfrom my laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my time to\ncome. I pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart.\nAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank\nand how much I deposited there. I will also issue you a Letter of Authority\nthat will empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund. My\nhappiness would be if my last wish is obeyed. Please always be prayerful\nall through and try as much as possible to learn from my lessons in your\nlife.\nAlso, Please assure me that you will act just as I have stated herein. Hope\nto hear from you soon and God bless you and members of your family. Contact\nme through my private e-mail  address (\nterrygreen078@gmail.com\n). God be with\nyou.\nRegards,\nMr. TERRY GREEN.
