        "body": "  From The Desk Of: Mr.Musa Bello Buhari\nDirector of finance and Audit Unit.\nDebt Management Commission,(DMC)\nOffice of the Presidency\nATTN: ,\nI am Mr. Musa Bello Buhari, Director of finance and Audit Unit Debt Management Commission,(DMC) Office of the Presidency.\nI just assume office last week as the new Director of finance and Audit Unit Debt Management Commission and I came across your payment file on my desk after our investigation. We discovered the reason why you have not received your funds all these years. We decided to contact you. Now I would like you to ask yourself the reason why you have not yet received your funds after you have paid all the fees that you were not supposed to pay because as I was going through your payment file, I found out that you are not owing any amount. So you should ask yourself why after paying all the fees you have not yet received your fund up till now .\nDid you authorize a man called Mr. Geoffrey Dennis from USA to receive your funds,he has contacted my office to release your funds to him and I do not know who sent him, could it be you? am wondering why he knows that your fund is under our care and I also want to know if you are the one that sent this man called Mr. Geoffrey Dennis to contact my office and ask for the release of your fund to him, in his email he said that you die of covid-19 year 2020 and before you die you instructed him to receive your fund as your next of kin and business partner.\nLet me be honest to you, you are aware that you are not the rightful beneficiary to this fund. The fund originated from someone who executed a contract here, but your name was used as the next of kin to this fund. So as a matter of fact, if you are ready to receive this fund,I will want you to forward us your full information to me if you are ready to receive the fund.\nMoreover, I want you to  understand that if someone has a problem and you do not take out time to find out the root cause of your problem you will not be able to get a solution to that problem. So I need you to contact me back with your full information so that I will explain to you why you have not received your funds and what you need to do to solve this problem.\nThe total amount of funds that we are talking about is USD$20.5Million.\nI look forward to your urgent response, If You Are Still Alive.\nRegards,\nMr. Musa Bello Buhari.

        "body": "Hello Mr. Musa Bello Buhari,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and congratulations on your new position as the Director of Finance and Audit Unit Debt Management DMC Office. I must say, your message has left me quite surprised.\n\nI'm not aware of any funds that I should be receiving, nor do I recall authorizing a Mr. Geoffrey Dennis from the USA to receive any funds on my behalf. It's quite puzzling how he would know about these funds and claim that I have passed away.\n\nAs for the fund originating from someone who executed a contract here, could you please provide more details? Who is this person and what was the nature of this contract?\n\nYou mentioned that my name was used as the next of kin to this fund. How did this happen? And why was my name chosen?\n\nLastly, you asked for my full information. Could you please specify what kind of information you need? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
