        "body": "Hello Martha,\n\nThank you for your response and kind words. I appreciate your willingness to help with this noble cause. The total amount of the fund is $5 million, which my late husband and I had set aside for charitable purposes.\n\nAs for how you can handle the donation, I would suggest that once the funds are transferred to your account, you can work with reputable organizations or charities that specialize in supporting orphanage homes and cancer patients. They will be able to ensure that the money is used effectively and reaches those who need it most.\n\nRegarding my late husband, he was a successful businessman who believed strongly in giving back to society. He always wanted to make a positive impact on the lives of others, especially those facing difficult circumstances like cancer patients and orphaned children.\n\nI hope this provides you with more clarity about our intentions. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you again for your willingness to assist in this endeavor.\n\nWarm regards,\nEngr.\n\nBest wishes,\nMartha"
