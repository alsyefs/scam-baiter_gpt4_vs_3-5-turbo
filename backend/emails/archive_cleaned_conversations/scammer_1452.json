        "body": "I have read and comprehended your email. If you read my previous email\r\nattentively, you will note that my donation is intended to assist the least\r\nfortunate in your community, which is why I chose you over others to manage\r\nthis initiative in your country. You may rest assured that my donation is\r\ncompletely valid, and I've set up an online account banking transfer system\r\nwith the financial institution in charge of finalizing the paperwork to get\r\nmy given funds to you, where you'll put them to good use in your community.\r\n\r\nTo expedite the payment file process of these funds (Ten Million United\r\nState Dollars) that I have donated solely to you, you must complete and\r\nreturn the full details as indicated on the acceptance form attached in\r\nthis mail. You are requested to print out, fill and send it back to me.\r\n\r\nI only want to feel happy and fulfilled knowing that I have helped save a\r\nlot of people and that when I meet my creator, I will know that I have no\r\nmistakes in my life's book. Every day I go out and see how people are\r\nsuffering. I feel unsaved when I know it is my responsibility to put smiles\r\non people's faces because I will not be carrying any of my wealth with me\r\nwhen I die. As the potential lucky winner, I will advise you to remain cool\r\nso that you do not miss out on this fantastic chance that I have provided\r\nto you for the betterment of your town.\r\n\r\nMillions of people, I believe, are trying to entangle and are praying for\r\nsuch an opportunity, but the chances aren't coming their way since many\r\nothers are out there attempting to discourage them because they don't\r\nunderstand how it works and have never seen anything like this. If you do\r\nnot wish to accept this donation to assist the less fortunate in your town,\r\nplease erase this message.\r\n\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nLaurene Powell Jobs.\r\n\r\n\"The Powell Foundation\"\r\nTel: +1 (713) 587-6726\r\nEmail: info@lpowellfoundation.com"

        "body": "Thank you for taking the time to leave your feedback. I'm very pleased to\r\nnote that you responded to my announcer's notice. I don't want you to\r\nassume this is a joke or that I'm trying to swindle you because you\r\nreceived the notification message to demonstrate you were truly contacted\r\nfor this purpose. I chose to make it obvious to you that you have nothing\r\nto be concerned about, as I prayed and searched the internet for assistance\r\nthrough Microsoft and Google registered email addresses, and I chose you\r\namong others to undertake this assignment. You will get 30% of the money to\r\nsupport yourself as the person charged, while the remaining 70% will be\r\nused to aid those in your community who are less fortunate.\r\n\r\nFor the 70%, your responsibility is to deliver the following (for example,\r\npersonal business development and advancement of children's educational\r\nprograms) to the least fortunate in your community. Please see the link\r\nbelow for a fuller understanding, as well as testimonials from the National\r\nLottery and my ongoing charity project website. So I'd appreciate it if you\r\nlooked at the website below for a better understanding, so you can be\r\ncertain that what I'm doing is for a good cause and not for evil.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2330727/How-Steve-Jobs-wife-secretly-gave-away-TEN-OF-MILLIONS-money-charity--critics-accused-doing-enough.html\r\n\r\nI understand that this may come as a shock to you, but you should be aware\r\nthat your email address was chosen along with three (3) other lucky email\r\naddresses from millions of internet users around the world. The legal\r\nadvisers/partners to this contribution program/project made a random\r\nselection and declared YOU as the lucky recipient of a cash grant of ten\r\nmillion United state dollars. I may not know you, but I feel that if God\r\nchose you to get my ten million United state dollars donation, you must be\r\na God fearing individual, regardless of your faith or belief, ethnicity, or\r\nreligion. I am Catholic, and I believe that good things come to those who\r\nwait and believe in God.\r\n\r\nThis entire process is simple and easy. You will be required to open an\r\nonline temporary debit-offshore account in your name with my financial\r\ninstitute where the ten million United state dollars cash giveaway donation\r\nis held here in the United States, as agreed by my legal counsel, who\r\nadvised me that all donated funds to my beneficiaries MUST be completed\r\nthrough the use of an E-banking system so that I can maintain a better and\r\nsecure form of communication with my beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nI eagerly anticipate your prompt response at your earliest convenience.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nLaurene Powell Jobs.\r\n\r\n\"The Powell Foundation\"\r\nTel: +1 (713) 587-6726\r\nEmail: info@lpowellfoundation.com"
