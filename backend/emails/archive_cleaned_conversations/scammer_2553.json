        "body": "Hello Mr. Smith John,\n\nThank you for reaching out and informing me about this situation. It's quite surprising to hear that my name was among the victims who lost a lot of money. I must admit, I'm not entirely sure how this happened.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this overdue fund? How did it end up being deposited with your bank? And why is it now being transferred to my account?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"stop all contact going on between you and anybody on internet\"? Are there specific people or types of interactions I should be avoiding?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMartha"

It's really kind of you to reach out and help me with this situation. \n\nCould you please tell me more about how this process works? How did the US government come to decide on transferring these funds? And why is it that I have pending funds since the beginning of the year?\n\nI'm also curious about what you mean by \"interrupt any further with you and anyone\".

Is there another way we could proceed with this?\n\nBest wishes,\nMartha"
