Could you tell me more about how they\r\ndetermine the amount to pay for each package? I'm curious to learn about\r\ntheir process.\r\n\r\nAnswer: Cargo Manager Airport Cargo Service said they charge per Weight and\r\nSize and excess of the lagage and the dumerage of your box which is 1 month\r\nwith them, he said they have calculated everything and it came out to\r\n$4,500.00\r\n\r\nTheir weight limitation is typically 5kg/11lbs (free carrier), and anything\r\nabove that will be charged as an excess weight and the box is 28kg/61.6\r\nlbs. I asked him how much did they charge for the excess weight of 23kg and\r\n30 days demurrage, he said they charge $100 per day on demurrage multiply\r\nby 30 days which is $3,000.00 only, then the excess weight of 23kg is $65\r\nper 1kg which is $1,495.00 so approximately the total is $4,495.00\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion 2. Hello! Thank you for sharing that information. Can you tell me\r\nmore about why they need my personal details and ID for checking purposes?\r\nI just want to understand the process better.\r\n\r\nAnswer. I have answered this question before, they are using it to cross\r\ncheck if the information pasted on the box matches with your information.\r\nThere is nothing bad about it, a lot of people are doing reconfirmation of\r\ntheir information to cross check and to make sure you are the real owner.\r\nFeel free about your information, it will hasten the process."
