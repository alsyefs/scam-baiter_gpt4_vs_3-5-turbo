Dear Christopher, 09/02/2024, With regard to your email, we wish to state clearly that we have no record of your details with the lottery commission, although we are very familiar with Precision Logistics and Diplomatic Delivery Services because we often assign the task of getting winners' packages delivered to them through Precision Logistics and Diplomatic Delivery Services. In other to elaborate further, I suggest you provide us with your winning reference number so that we can provide adequate answers to your questions.  I think this question should be channeled directly to Precision Logistics and Diplomatic Delivery Services, however, kindly provide your winning reference number for record purposes and you will be supplied with the desirable answers you seek. Regards Mr. Alexander Fred Prize Remittance Director."
