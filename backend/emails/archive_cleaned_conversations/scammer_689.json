We have programmed your funds to bank to bank wire transfer today, and have initiated the important legal process for your funds transfer to your bank account. Be informed that because of the challenges we encountered with the United States law enforcement agencies, and the government financial regulatory agencies during our funds payment through the US banks. We decided to redirect all our international debt payments to our approved bank in Nigeria called Zenith International bank PLC. We have been able to transfer funds to some beneficiaries bank account successfully through this new bank. \r\nIn order to proceed with the same legal process that enabled the bank transfer funds to other beneficiaries banks successfully, We need you to send the following important information to us immediately:\r\n1)  Your Full Name and current home or office address2)  Copy of your valid identification document3)  Full details of your bank account coordinates where the money will be transferred into.\r\nWe will work together with our legal department to swear an affidavit of funds ownership with your names and address in the court of justice, your identification document will be registered in the court and notary to confirm that you are the real owner of the funds and no other person can claim ownership of the funds. Your bank account coordinates will be registered and notarized in the court as the authentic bank account where the funds will be transferred into. Finally, We will secure a restraining court order in your favor, to restrain all the law enforcement agencies from interfering/stopping your funds transfer from getting into your final bank account. \r\nThe above are the legal process we must complete to enable the bank transfer the $35m into your bank account successfully without any problem. We hope to receive the required information from you soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe await your Reply\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nMr. Serigne Mamdou ECOWAS Funds Payment CoordinatorE-mail: ecowasdebtpayment@aol.com"
