        "body": "Hello Hector,\n\nThank you for your response. I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. The purpose of obtaining an Affidavit of Claim from the Federal High Court is to ensure that the European Union can verify the identity of the person receiving the Western Union money. It is a legal document that will allow us to change your name as the receiver.\n\nRegarding the cost of obtaining the Affidavit, it is only . Once this payment is made, our Legal Department will issue and legalize the document at the Federal High Court. After that, we can provide you with the new MTCN numbers for you to use.\n\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to pay for the Affidavit directly at a Western Union office or agent when picking up your money. The cost needs to be paid first before we can proceed with issuing and legalizing the document.\n\nI hope this clarifies things for you. If you have any more questions or concerns, please let me know.\n\nBest wishes,\nHector"
