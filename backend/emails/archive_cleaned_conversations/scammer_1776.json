        "body": "Dear Monique,\r\n\r\nI am pleased to receive your response with it content well understood and noted:\r\n\r\nApologies for the delay in response and Misunderstanding.\r\n\r\nWe are busy making efforts to ensure that once you receive your funds\r\nyou will have no problem accessing it. The total funds you are to\r\nreceive is $2.5 million USD only.\r\n\r\nThrough this important letter, I wish to notify you that I have been\r\nable to rectify the abnormalities which was observed on your payment\r\nfile. Furthermore,\r\n\r\nBelow are the lists of payment options available for you to choose as\r\nyour prefer payment choice.\r\n\r\n1. Bitcoin: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and I donâ€™t know if you are\r\nfamiliar with cryptocurrency. It is one of the fastest growing money\r\nmarkets globally. It has a lot of benefits such as self-service, easy\r\nto operate, lesser cost, fast to use for receiving and transferring\r\nlarge sum of money without protocol or financial authority\r\ninterference in your transaction.($420)\r\n\r\n2. ATM Card: An ATM card can be issued in your name by the card\r\ndepartment in the bank. It is functional in any bank in the world with\r\ndaily cash withdraw limit of five thousand United States dollars\r\n($5,000) but the card can be programmed and activated to withdraw\r\nabove thousand United States dollars ($5,000) with your request. The\r\ncard will be delivered to your nominated home address by our\r\naffiliated delivery company or you come in person to the bank to pick\r\nup the card by yourself.($610)\r\n\r\n3. Business bank to bank wire transfer: in this process your personal\r\nbank account credentials will be requested from you to enable us to\r\ninitiate the transfer of your total funds to your designated bank\r\naccount and generate electronic receipt that will help you to confirm\r\nthe transaction with your bank.($499)\r\n\r\n4. Online banking, also known as internet banking, virtual banking,\r\nweb banking or home banking, is a system that enables customers of a\r\nbank or other financial institution to conduct a range of financial\r\ntransactions through the financial institution's website or mobile\r\napp. Since the early 2000s this has become the most common way that\r\ncustomers access their bank accounts.\r\n\r\nThe online banking system will typically connect to or be part of the\r\ncore banking system operated by a bank to provide customers access to\r\nbanking services in addition to or in place of historic branch\r\nbanking. Online banking significantly reduces the banks' operating\r\ncost by reducing reliance on a branch network and offers convenience\r\nto some customers by lessening the need to visit a branch bank as well\r\nas being able to perform banking transactions even when branches are\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nInternet banking provides personal and corporate banking services\r\noffering features such as making electronic payments, viewing account\r\nbalances, obtaining statements, checking recent transactions and\r\ntransferring money between accounts.\r\n\r\nSome banks operate as a \"direct bank\" or \"neobank\" that operate\r\nentirely via the internet or internet and telephone without having any\r\nphysical branches relying completely on their online banking\r\nfacilities. (cost $585)\r\n\r\nRegards to your question to know if there are any additional charges\r\nor hidden fees that you should be aware of.my dear this is the only\r\nrequired fees needed speaking in Transparency to you as it is the most\r\nimportant to you in this matters.so the mentioned cost for each\r\noption, remains the only cost required of you.\r\n\r\nI hereby urge you to get back to me with the confirmation of your\r\nchoice or option for receiving your funds, and with the little cost\r\nattach to each of then.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour kind attention is highly required to facilitate the payment\r\nprocess, therefore, I encourage you to adhere to the above given\r\ninstructions by making your choice or option for receiving your Funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and be blessed.\r\n\r\nJesus is lord.\r\nVery truly yours, in a union of prayer for you and all dear to your heart.\nYours Faithfully.\r\nMr.Scott Brannan"

This is the fees associated with this\r\noption ($420)00 USD.\r\n\r\nSecondly, if you choose the ATM card option, It usually take within 48\r\nhours.for the card to be delivered to your nominated home address.it\r\ncost($610).00 USD.
