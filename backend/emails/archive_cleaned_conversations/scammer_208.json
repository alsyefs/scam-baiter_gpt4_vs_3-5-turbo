It's quite a surprise as I don't remember participating in any lottery, but it's a pleasant one nonetheless.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please provide more details about this lottery? When was it held and how was my email address selected? Also, could you clarify the role of the European Union committee on Foreign Payment in this process?\n\nI'm also curious about the visit from one of your American bank representatives. Could you tell me more about what this meeting would entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nMark"
