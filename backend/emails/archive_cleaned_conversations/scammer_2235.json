        "body": "Hello Jill, I'm glad you reached out. It's great to hear about the US Dollars support you've been awarded for victims of torture. The process seems straightforward - they will be sending you the funds through an ATM Visa Card which already has the credited amount on it. \n\nTo receive the card, they are requesting your postal address, a copy of your Passport or ID bearing your name, and your phone number for delivery purposes. Once you have the card, you can withdraw the funds from any ATM machine.\n\nAs for how you were selected for this payment, it would be interesting to know more details about that. Have you had any previous involvement with organizations supporting victims of torture? Do you have any idea why they specifically chose you for this award?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more from you!\n\nBest wishes,\nJill"
