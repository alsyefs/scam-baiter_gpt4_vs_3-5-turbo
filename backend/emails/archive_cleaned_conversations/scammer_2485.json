        "body": "Hello Mr. Sarata KONE,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite exciting to hear about this ATM card from the UBA Bank and the United Nations. I must say, it's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind me asking. You mentioned that the ATM card is currently empty and will only be loaded once it reaches me. Could you please explain why this is so? \n\nAlso, could you provide more information about these courier services? How can I be sure that they are reliable and my ATM card will reach me safely?\n\nLastly, regarding the payment methods - RIA MONEY TRANSFER, MONEYGRAM or WESTERN UNION - could you please provide more details on how these work? I'm not very familiar with them.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRebecca"
