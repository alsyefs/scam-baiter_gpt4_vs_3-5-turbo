Anyone who does such by boycotting\r\ncompulsory and prestigious offices will end up having himself to blame for\r\nit. These are cases where you have interception of funds, delay of release\r\nof funds and more endless fees for violating due remittance procedures and\r\nat the end, the beneficiary will be the one to go in for the damages .Bank\r\ncannot grant you a smooth transfer  for this purpose unless  all the\r\nnecessary  documents are secured. Without these documents in place, your\r\nfund transfer can’t be accessed and as well as any other financial\r\nactivities until this paper work is duly obtained. We will not\r\nencourage/support violation of international Laws because an affidavit oath\r\ncertificate of your funds must be secure on your name as the rightful\r\nbeneficiary on or before a UN paying bank will commence with the crediting\r\nof your funds into your bank account, so there must be charges from the\r\nattorney which you will pay him to enable him go to court to obtain it so\r\nprepare yourself for that  and you are advice to reconfirm this information\r\nbelow to enable us direct you to the attorney that will help you secure the\r\naffidavit oath clearance certificate of your fund, so we need this\r\ninformation below.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, you are not required to pay any money or fee,therefore\r\nthe question of how much you will need to pay, shouldn’t arise.

In view of the above,\r\nyou are required to provide us with your\r\n\r\nFull Names,\r\nFull office and Home Addresses,\r\nAge, Marital Status\r\nOccupation\r\nOffice Telephone and mobile phone numbers.\r\nAny of your ID card OR your passport\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as we receive this information from you, we will immediately direct\r\nyou to the accredited attorney that will help you in securing the affidavit\r\noath certificate of your funds as the rightful beneficiary for a UN paying\r\nbank to commence with the crediting of your funds into your bank account as\r\nyou will provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, try reconfirm all the information as we have requested to enable\r\nus apply to NY court of appeal unit for the swearing of the affidavit oath\r\ncertificate of your funds as the rightful beneficiary while you bear in\r\nmind that the affidavit oath certificate fee of your funds will be paid on\r\nor before a UN paying bank will commence with the crediting of your funds\r\ninto your bank account as the rightful beneficiary of the funds because it\r\ncost money to get it here in NY court of appeal, so get yourself arrange\r\nbut just a little money which i know will not be problem for you, so let\r\nhave all the information as we have stated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a blessed day while we wait to hear back from you and with all the\r\ninformation as we have stated and as soon as possible,\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for your understanding and cooperation.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\nDon Callahan, LLP\r\nDirector United States Reconciliation Committee"
