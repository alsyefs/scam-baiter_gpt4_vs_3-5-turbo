Rawan Alkhalaf, a female single am Libya Citizen, But I and my parents relocated to Turkey when the war broke out in Libya 2011 since then we have been living in Turkey Gaziantep province until the recent earthquake that made me lose my parents which has affected me so much.  I need your kind and urgent assistance to build a sincere and honest relationship. My late dad deposited $55 Million Dollars cash in a private security vault at Dubai United Arab Emirate.\nMeanwhile, I wish to solicit for your services to be my foreign partner/investor and support me to transfer and manage my funds by investing in profit making ventures like buying of company shares, Real Estate Investment Trust funds, or Agriculture. I am ready to part 30% of entire funds to you as your own gratification while the 70% will be strictly for the investment. At the successful transfer of the funds, I will relocate to your country.\nI have no experience or perfection in running a business; I would like you to help me invest it in your country. I will send you all the documents relating to the funds once I hear from you with good intention to assist me. Please, if you are interested to collaborate with me kindly contact me on my private email \nmissrawanalkahalaf@gmail.com\n for more details.\nMay Allah/God bless you earnestly.\nYours Sincerely,\nMiss Rawan   "

        "body": "Hello Miss Rawan,\n\nThank you for your detailed email. It's quite an interesting situation you've found yourself in! I'm curious about a few things, though.\n\nFirstly, how did your late father come to deposit such a large sum of money in a private security vault in Dubai? That must have been quite the undertaking. \n\nSecondly, I'm intrigued by the legal process you mentioned. Could you explain it a bit more? How does one go about preparing a power of attorney and what exactly does it entail?\n\nLastly, I'm flattered that you're considering investing in my country's Real Estate business. However, I'd like to know more about why you chose this particular industry and why you believe it would be a good investment.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nBrian"
