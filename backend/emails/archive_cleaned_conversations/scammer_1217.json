        "body": "*Greetings and compliments,*\r\n\r\nFollowing the receipt of your email, I am confident that you have the\r\ncapacity to invest the Loan Funds into profitable and viable projects in\r\nyour country. In fact, you have come to the right place, and I assure you\r\nthat this transaction shall be 100% successful. The Loan Funds you require\r\nfor all projects, will be credibly processed, approved and the Money will\r\nbe absolutely available and credited to any receiving bank account of your\r\nchoice within 5 days.\r\nBy virtue of the proficiency and estimable services of the lender (Finance\r\nCompany). In fact, they are the best and most authentic finance company\r\nwith a credible record of competence and fidelity. Their proven reputation\r\nand great integrity have kept them ahead of many other finance companies\r\nglobally.\r\n\r\nApparently, you are highly privileged to be connected to the Finance\r\nCompany, because once they approve your application for Loan, they must\r\nfulfill their promises and the LOAN AMOUNT must be successfully transferred\r\nto your account, successfully.\r\nI have been working with competent Finance Companies since the past twelve\r\n(12) years as an accredited Financial Consultant with the eligibility to\r\nsubmit names of trusted borrowers with viable projects. By virtue of my\r\ncredibility, diligence and capability, ALL borrowers who passed through me,\r\nhave remained faithful with the terms of the Loan, after receiving the\r\nrequested loan amounts. And, after months of remitting the Loan Funds, the\r\nLenders have visited their projects on yearly basis and everything has\r\nconsistently remained in order.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I usually sign some attestation documents and also submit my\r\nparticulars of my fixed asset (as part of collateral) emphasizing that a\r\nborrower is reliable with ability to invest the huge amount of Loan Funds\r\nrequested; the Lender always believes my attestation and approves because\r\nof my consistency and integrity. All financial institutions prioritize the\r\nfuture of the Funds (asset) when released to the borrower.\r\nI usually conduct the due diligence and certify the credibility of a\r\nborrower. Actually, if you default in any part of the Loan terms, it will\r\ncause me to lose my reputation, accreditation and my fixed assets submitted\r\nto the Loan Office before I was legitimately accredited to facilitate\r\nprovision of Loan to reliable borrowers.\r\n\r\nNOTE that when you arrive in the United Kingdom, you will first have a\r\nmeeting with the Executive Officials of a Finance Company (in their Office)\r\nin the United Kingdom, where you will have the opportunity to physically\r\nanswer some questions about your project plan, investment capabilities and\r\nrepayment plans.\r\n\r\nThe financing procedure is this: Tenure of loan is 25years at 1% (one\r\npercent) interest rate annually, with grace period of 3years. We believe\r\nand proclaim that financing of projects should be simple, transparent,\r\nconvenient and realistic.\r\nThe borrower should proceed to Fill his details on the attached LOAN\r\nAPPLICATION FORM, and return the filled / signed copy.\r\n\r\n*Kind Regards,*\r\n\r\n\r\n*Sir JAMES HARRIES*\r\n*Financial Advisor/Facilitator*\r\n*Email: jamesharriesmbe@outlook.com <jamesharriesmbe@outlook.com>*"
