        "body": "WELCOME TO SHARK TRADE ACCOUNT\n(NOTE: IF THIS MESSAGE IS FOUND IN SPAM FOLDER, MOVE IT TO THE INBOX, ITS DUE TO THE SECURITY IMPOSED ON THE EMAIL TO DISTRACT INTERNET HACKERS AND PROTECT YOUR FUNDS)\nPLEASE READ MY MESSAGE TO THE END AND UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING\nHi Dear\nMERRY CHRISTMAS\nI am still hoping we can finalize the transaction today, i am very confident and 100% certain that this will pull through successfully, I have certified all the claims and confirmed every ENTRY MADE on your transaction, In other words, all the FINANCE SECURITY details are intact, there is no way any other fee will pop from nowhere, because i have handled the previous details and i can tell you, that your money is secured , once we are done with the RECLAIM TRANSFER AGREEMENT,  I am here to help you and restore back your faith and trust for humanity this season, Mr. James committed his life to this before giving up, if it was a fluke I wouldn't be here on christmas EVE to pick up from where he dropped after a year. I have been on this job for a couple of years and honesty is what leads me, i might not be too perfect but I know my boundaries and I don't step on people's toes nor do I take advantage of people's weaknesses or Trust.\nI will get every single details of your transaction finalized in couple of minutes after you send the $250 usd\n, i can comfortably promise you that nothing will ever stop me from finalizing your transaction as i have promised you, Mr. James has already completed every details before the fund was secured after he passed away, once i am able to obtain your RECLAIM TRANSFER AGREEMENT from the IMF, Your account will be activated back and ready to transfer from the online account to your personal bank account, you can also order for a UNIVERSAL ATM MASTER CARD from your account. I won't be able to access anything and I do not have the power over anything until I have access to the RECLAIM DOCUMENTS for your ACCOUNT and that is why $250 usd is needed to make this whole process possible this christmas Eve.\nDo you know that BITCOIN is a decentralized alternative to the banking system. This means that the system can operate and transfer funds from one account to another without any central authority. With a central authority, transferring money is easy. Eg, just tell the bank you want to remove $50 from your bank account and add it to someone else account. In this example, the bank has all the power because the bank is the one that is allowed to update your account / ledger that holds the balances of everyone in the system. But how do you create a system that has a decentralized authority or ledger without giving them too much power in case they become corrupt or negligent in their work.\nNow this is where SHARK TRADE FUNDS comes in, when a bank holds a transaction for you, they will have full control of how the money will be transferred and this is why you have been paying banks all over and over and still the money hasn't been sent to you. Once i am able to get this Reclaim Permits, nothing will ever come in the way between you and your funds, if anyone demands for any payment from you after the $250 usd is sent, the person deserves to DIE because he or she is wicked and if i ever demand for any payment from you after this, let I susan miles not live to see 2024 new year. Please trust me.\nHere is the information where to pay the $250 fee. Pay it bank to bank or you pay it by Gift card or bitcoin wallet any one you choose, pay it and receive your funds ok.\nAccount name: Alonzo Connell\nGreen Dot Bank\nBank Address.1675 Freedom Blvd. Provo UT. 84604\nAccount number, 6980 4846 6770\nRouting number 124303120\nReceiver's Address..4428 Edson.Ave.Bronx.new york.10466.\n==================================================================\nBitcin wallet Address..( bc1q86s72dmuv0q9gmdj6sd0ez38xtycpg7m3gwxph )\n========================================================================\nThank you for reading til the end, i believe we can finally work something out.\nI will be expecting to hear back from you\nThank You\nSusan Miles"
