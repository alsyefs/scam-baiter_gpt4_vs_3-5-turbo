        "body": "Dear, \n\nFirstly, I am glad to receive your response, and it is my pleasure to provide you with more information regarding the Covid-19 compensation funds. \nThese funds were allocated as Covid-19 compensation by the World Health Organization and World Bank, and were approved by the United Nations. \n\nThe main objective of these funds was to aid individuals during the challenging period of the Covid-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, due to the misconduct of certain corrupt bank officials who acted out of their own self-interest, some funds were misappropriated. \n\nConsequently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been conducting an extensive investigation over the years to ensure that the funds are properly distributed and reach their rightful owners. After a thorough process, the IMF has successfully recovered a portion of the misappropriated funds. As a result, we are now tasked with delivering these funds to their rightful owners, and you happen to be on the list of recipients. \n\nTo ensure security and prevent any further misappropriation, the funds have been stored in a non-escrow account under the custody of the IMF. This means that the funds can only be released to the designated owner, which is you. We have also arranged for a MasterCard with no spending limit to provide you with unrestricted access to your funds. \nTo proceed with the necessary documentation and formalities, we kindly request that you provide us with your personal information for reconfirmation. This will enable us to ensure accuracy and facilitate the smooth transfer of funds. \n\nPlease provide the following details at your earliest convenience: \nFull Name: \nContact Address: \nPhone Number: \nEmail Address: \nRest assured that your personal information will be treated with utmost confidentiality and used solely for the purpose of the fund transfer process. \n\nOnce we receive the required information, we will promptly proceed with the necessary paperwork to finalize the transfer. Should you have any questions or require further clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. \n\nThank you for your cooperation, and we look forward to helping you access your rightful funds.\nBest regards, \nJohn Morrison \n\nFinancial Trust Federal Credit Union"
