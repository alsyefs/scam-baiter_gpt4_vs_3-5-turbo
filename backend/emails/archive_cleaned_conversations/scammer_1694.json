        "body": "Dear Dorothy,\r\n\r\nYour email was well received, as such please find further clarification.\r\n\r\nThis is a Listserv at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\r\n\r\nEPA releases 2024 update to Equity Action Plan\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released the 2024 update to its\r\nEquity Action Plan, as part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s\r\nwhole-of-government equity agenda. This Equity Action Plan is part of EPA’s\r\nefforts to implement the President’s Executive Order on “Further Advancing\r\nRacial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through The Federal\r\nGovernment,” which reaffirmed the Administration’s commitment to ensure\r\nequity and build an America in which all can participate, prosper, and\r\nreach their full potential.\r\n\r\n“Equity is at the heart of all that we do at EPA. Striving for equity makes\r\nit possible for us to deliver on our mission to protect public health and\r\nprovide a clean environment for all,” said EPA Deputy Administrator Janet\r\nMcCabe. “The progress that we have made and this update to our Equity\r\nAction Plan show our continued commitment to uplifting everyone, and we are\r\nproud to be a part of this work.”\r\n\r\nFollowing robust engagement with community stakeholders, EPA identified\r\neight priority strategies, which include four previously identified\r\npriorities carried forward from the 2022 Equity Action Plan and four newly\r\nidentified strategies to support communities that have been historically\r\nunderserved, as well as all communities across our Nation, these eight\r\npriority strategies are:\r\n\r\n    Improve access for Communities to Federal Assistance.\r\n    Reduce Cumulative Impacts and Health Disparities.\r\n    Strengthen our Civil Rights Compliance Program.\r\n    Protect Children from Exposures to Environmental Harms.\r\n    Address Inequitable Access to Resources for Rural Communities.\r\n    Ensure Public Access to EPA Programs and Address Environmental Harms\r\nfor People with Disabilities.\r\n    Strengthening Community-Based Participatory Science to Achieve\r\nEnvironmental Equity.\r\n    Improve Data and Analytic Capacity to Better Identify and Remove\r\nBarriers.\r\n\r\nSince the release of its first-ever Equity Action Plan in 2022, EPA has:\r\n\r\n    Selected 11 Environmental Justice Thriving Community Technical\r\nAssistance Centers to receive a total of $600 million dollars through the\r\nInflation Reduction Act to reduce barriers when accessing federal grant\r\nfunding and will make approximately 2,000 subawards directly impacting and\r\naddressing issues at the community level.\r\n    Created a robust technical assistance program to help eligible\r\norganizations access the $2 billion dollars available through the\r\nEnvironmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants Program.\r\n    Awarded over $11 billion to date in clean water investments from the\r\nBipartisan Infrastructure Law under the State Revolving Funds, with at\r\nleast 49% of this funding to go to disadvantaged communities.\r\n\r\nAs the backbone of work at EPA under the Biden-Harris Administration, the\r\nfocus remains on ensuring no one is left behind because of the color of\r\ntheir skin or the zip code where they reside.\r\nRefer to how the card works, upon issuance of the card by Citizens Equity\r\nbank and being delivered to you which is a MasterCard and can be used\r\nanywhere in any  part of the world that accepts Interswitch.\r\n\nYours Sincerely\r\nVictor Smith\r\nTel: (321) 621-0778\r\nInternational Payment Department\r\nCitizens Equity Bank"
