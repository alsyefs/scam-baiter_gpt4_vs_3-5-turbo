        "body": "Hello Sgt. Janet Stone,\n\nIt's a pleasure to make your acquaintance! Your story is quite intriguing, and I must say it sounds like you're in quite a predicament over there in Syria. It's fascinating to hear about your involvement with the United Nations Oil for food program.\n\nI'm curious, how did you manage to secure such a contract? And why is your government against these contracts? It seems like they would be beneficial for everyone involved.\n\nAs for me, well, I lead a simple life. I don't do anything particularly exciting for a living. Just the usual 9-5 grind, you know? As for family, well, that's a bit of a sensitive topic. Let's just say it's complicated.\n\nI'm afraid I can't provide the personal information you requested though. You see, I've been advised not to share such details online due to security reasons. But rest assured, I am very interested in hearing more about your situation and how I might be able to assist.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nDebra"

I really understand what it takes\r\nto accumulate such huge amount of funds under your care, for this reason, I\r\nam willing to share it equal as I am not a greedy person and hence my dad\r\nand mom are dead and am the only child.so as it stands right now you\r\nrepresent my prospect partner because this deal is what we do together but\r\nplease make sure that my share is well secured until I complete my service\r\nhere and come over to meet with you.\r\n\r\nKnow that I am free with you because I have trusted you with all my heart\r\nin this deal. So please do not let me down. You may not understand why I am\r\ndoing this but I know even if I passed away, your prayer and the prayer of\r\nthe orphanage will secure me a place in paradise.\r\n\r\nAnd remember they don't know the content of the safe boxes except me and\r\nyou.
