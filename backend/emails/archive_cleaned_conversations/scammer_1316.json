        "body": "Dear Teresa,\r\n\r\nThank you for your quick response and your good interest in this transaction, before i go further, let me introduce myself properly, My name is Mr. Johnson Morgan, I am the Operation/Regional Branch Head Manager of Credit Grand Alliance Banking Plc London, I am 54 years happily married to Mrs. Julian Morgan and we are blessed with two boys and one girl.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main reason why I contacted you and ask for your assistance in this transaction is the fact that the Credit Grand Alliance Bank has no moral justification to inherit the funds, as an insider in the bank I have all the information that we may need to apply to afford it, without facing any problem, if we do not claim the funds the bank will confiscate the funds and make themselves richer, while there are one million people out there who are unemployed and seeking for employment, I firmly believe that we can open up companies through the proceed of this transaction and create more job opportunities to better the lives of others.\r\n\r\nAll I need from you is your honest cooperation and assistance for us to make this deal successful, because I cannot do it alone, I want to officially introduce you to the bank as next of kin / beneficiary to the deceased's family, I have all the documents that the bank may require from you to prove that you are the next of kin / beneficiary, with your full information such as name and civil address, phone and fax numbers so that i can upload the information here on our bank central server, nothing will stop the bank from transferring the funds into your nominated bank account if you're willing to follow my instructions, I am here as insider I know what it takes to perform this operation. Do not entertain any fear, this transaction is 100% risk free, all i need to do is to ask my lawyer to go to court here in London to legalize all documents in my position in your name just to protect you from any breach of law.\r\n\r\nMy interest in this deal, I intend to invest part of my share in your country, so I'll be with you as soon as funds are transferred to your account in order to have my share, as I previously suggested 50% for me while 40% goes to you, while 10% will be set aside for any expenses that may rise for the transfer of the funds, I hope everything is ok with you?\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease, I would like to know what business you think we can invest into in your country, because I'm going to leave my profession of banking and go into full time private business, remember that your help is seriously needed here, as you know the economic  policy of your country better than me.\r\n\r\nPlease respond now, so I can send you an application form for transfer of fund, which you will fill correctly and send to the International remittance Department of Credit Grand Alliance Bank for further processing and transmission of funds to your bank account in your country.\r\n\r\nThis transaction will be completed in the next few days as soon as you start by responding immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will wait for your quick response and I am 100% ready to give you more detailed information, therefore feel very free to ask questions if there is anything you do not understand.\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance for your good understanding and assistance.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMr. Morgan."
