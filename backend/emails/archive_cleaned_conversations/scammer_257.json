I thank you so much for the interest that made you to reply my\r\nmail,   , I wish to inform you that if you can assist me in this project\r\nwill never be disappointed I am Dr Bello Mustafa    the Chairman Contract\r\nAward committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES\r\n(ECOWAS)with Headquarters in Lome,Togo. I contacted you sir, for an agent\r\nto assist me in the transfer of (US$35.5 MILLION) Thirty  Five      Million\r\nFive  Hundred Thousand UNITED STATES DOLLARS.\r\n\r\n We wish to transfer the sum of (US$35.5 MILLION) Thirty Five    –  Million\r\nFive  Hundred Thousand  UNITED STATES DOLLARS into your personal or\r\ncompany's bank account. This fund was a residue of the over invoiced\r\ncontract bills awarded by us for the Electrification of urban and rural\r\nareas, supply of hard/software, pharmaceutical products/medical\r\nequipment's, light and heavy duty vehicles, apparels for the ECOMOG in\r\nSierra-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping Projects.\r\n\r\nThis DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all the\r\nattendant lope holes sealed. As the Chairman of Chairman of Contract award\r\nCommittee (CAC) I have the cooperation and mandate of the Financial\r\nDirector and the Secretary of the Organization. We arranged and over\r\ninvoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies from different\r\ncountries during the crisis. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of\r\na willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this\r\nmoney out of West Africa. This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable\r\nand porous political nature of this sub-region.\r\n\r\nThe original contractors have been dully paid by the Banque Centrale Des\r\nEtats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African States)\r\nthrough our bank BANK OF AFRICA (BOA )  (BOA), LOME TOGO. This balance is\r\nsuspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of\r\nour choice. We intend to pay out this fund now as the organization is\r\nwinding up its activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the countries\r\nand the coast has been achieved.\r\n\r\nBased on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil servants working\r\nunder this organization, are not allowed to operate a foreign account. This\r\nis the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account that\r\ncan hold this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with your\r\nable advice, assistance and partnership in\r\nyour country.\r\n\r\nIt is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to allow you 40% of\r\nthe entire sum as compensation, 50% will be held on trust for us and 10 %\r\n will go for charity organization    This transaction will be successfully\r\nconcluded within seven    days if you accord us your unalloyed and due\r\ncooperation. Please if you are really interested and willing to execute\r\nthis project, kindly indicate so that i can send you the copy of the\r\napplication form which you will fill out with your account details and send\r\nto the office of the foreign contract verification and investigation panel\r\nfor payment approval. In your next reply i will like you to forward the\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\nYOUR PERSONAL ADDRESS,\r\nTELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)\r\nYOUR   OCCUPATION\r\nYOUR AGE\r\n\r\nI am waiting for your kind and urgent response.\r\n\r\nBELOW My Personal Data's:\r\n\r\nMy Country,Lome Togo West Africa.\r\n\r\nMy full name  Dr Bello Mustafa\r\nMy Wife Name Mrs.Marriam  Awa Mustafa\r\nMy House Address,No 17 Deacon Street\r\nLome Togo  West Africa.\r\nMy Position Bill And Exchange Manager and\r\n Chairman Contract Award\r\n committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY\r\n OF WESTAFRICAN STATES (ECOWAS)with\r\nHeadquarters in Lome,Togo.\r\nMy E-mail (bellomustafa55@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDr Bello Mustafa.\r\nThis Is My Direct Line And I want You To Call Me After Reading My\nDetails +228  91052495\r\nMy Home Address: No' 602 Ave. LOUDUN\r\n              B:P 3508\r\nLome Togo , West Africa."

        "body": "Hello Dr. Bello,\n\nThank you for your detailed response. I appreciate the time you took to explain everything so thoroughly.\n\nI understand that you need some documents from me to start this process, but could you please specify which ones exactly? You mentioned a proof of my company and account details, but I'm not sure what kind of proof you're referring to. Could it be a business license or something else?\n\nRegarding the MOU agreement, could you please elaborate on what it entails? What are the terms and conditions we would be agreeing upon? \n\nAlso, thank you for explaining about WAMA. It sounds like an important agency with significant responsibilities. However, I'm curious as to how our transaction fits into their role of promoting trade within West Africa. Could you provide more insight into this?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJesse"
