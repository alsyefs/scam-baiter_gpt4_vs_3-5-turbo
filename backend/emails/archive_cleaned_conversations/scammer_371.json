        "body": "*READ THE THREE MAILS CAREFULLY, COMPLETE INFORMATION WILL BE ON THE MOU*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThere would be an MOU that guides these loans, which would be sent to you.\r\nYou are to review, sign and return back to our managing director Dr. John\r\nSaheed on his official email address (johnsaheed@financemanagment.com).\r\nPlease kindly indicate the exact amount you are requesting for the loan.\r\nFirstly, these loans require a meeting in any of our offices which must\r\nhold for further discussion and signing of the loan documentation. Also,\r\nnote that the process is not strictly communicated by email, there must be\r\na physical meeting which would take place in any of our offices after which\r\nfunds would be disbursed to you. Without you coming for the physical\r\nmeeting, it will cost you because we would  recommend you to an attorney\r\nwho will stand for you, which is expensive. Our billionaire chairman do not\r\nlike it that way because of what is going on the internet and what is going\r\non in the world today, so no one will feel cheated which is why any of our\r\nclients needs to appear for the physical meeting, thumb prints,\r\ndocumentation signing and proceed together  to the bank for disbursement of\r\nyour loan funds to you which will happen same day if you arrive early. Be\r\ngood and smile because our billionaire chairman is globally connected with\r\nso many big banks and corresponding banks in the world, in which your loan\r\nfunds can be released once, bank draft or bit by bit depending on how you\r\nwant it released to you. The most important thing is the documentation and\r\nthe release is authentic and confirmable.\r\n\r\nYour information is being needed completely, because it stands as your\r\ncollateral. Please reconfirm\r\n\r\n- Full Name\r\n- Full address\r\n- Loan Amount Needed\r\n- Personal\\ WhatsApp telephone Number\r\n- Attach any copy of your valid identification (Passport or Driver's\r\nlicense)\r\n\r\nAs we said before, we are connected to various big banks all over the world\r\nand the corresponding bank is perfect, so there would never be any delay in\r\npayments. Our networking is wonderful and can never be compared with the\r\nrest of mind. I'm in charge of communication to inform our client to help\r\nthem understand our terms and guidelines for surrendering this loan before\r\ndirecting it to our managing director in charge. All our terms are simple,\r\nand collateral is straightforward which involves your full name, full\r\naddress, personal telephone number, and also the number you can reach on\r\nWhatsapp for the confidentiality guiding this loan. Our loan is 100% legit,\r\nwhich you would witness yourself in our various offices and bank\r\ntransactions so you have  nothing to worry about. We can transfer money\r\nanywhere in the world but if the loan is above $50 million would be split\r\nin batches. Again, our office can offer loans of 10 million (minimum) to 1\r\nbillion (maximum).\r\n\r\nCommunicating on the phone would commence as soon as the MOU has been\r\nsigned and sent back, our managing director Dr. John Saheed will\r\ncommunicate with you with his official email address and telephone number.\r\nThe information would be given to you as soon as the MOU is signed and\r\nreturned and you indicate the country you can travel to for the physical\r\nmeeting. We prefer meeting with our clients so they can witness the process\r\nof the loan, signing the documents themselves, all our clients are very\r\nhappy because we do not waste any of their time upon arrival. It takes a\r\nday process involving meetings in the morning at the office and at noon for\r\nthe bank release payments. Our clients can come in early and go back the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nIf you understand very well, then the next step is MOU. Please let me know\r\nif you need any clarification. In our previous emails, be informed that we\r\nhave our offices in Dubai, Netherland, London, Spain, Indonesia, Kuwait,\r\nBarren, Qatar or Turkey at which disbursement would be made. You are free\r\nto ask questions where you do not understand. Finally, if you are not\r\nbuoyant enough or capable of this loan you are free to refer someone who is\r\nwilling and capable, our loan remains the best with a 15 years grace and\r\nyou would manage it for 2years grace before the loan starts counting at\r\n1.5% Annual interest with the rest of mind. Get back to me with the details\r\nneeded, just go ahead and reconfirm please and also attach your\r\ninvestment\\project plan and whatsapp number where you can be reached and\r\nattach any of your valid identification. All our reconfirmation is to\r\nensure your details are correct and confirmed. I await your quick response.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nCFO\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI really want to work with you and for you to receive this loan and our\r\nloan remains one of the best in the world today because we give 15 years\r\nand 1.5% interest rate when you manage the funds for the loan for 2years.\r\nWe are happy people because my billionaire chairman is progressive who\r\nhelps people a lot who is an oil magnet and he owns a football club, you\r\nhave nothing to lose as the loan would be given to you to manage before you\r\nstart paying back the 1.5% interest. Your collateral is your address, a\r\nvalid identification and your personal telephone number and also the name\r\nyou wish to be in the MOU, either your personal or your company name.

Follow my instructions and reconfirm the details  if\r\nyou are interested in this loan and you will thank me later. Bank to bank\r\ntransfer without you appearing in any of our offices will cost you money\r\nupfront for clearance, that is why we made it mandatory for our client to\r\nvisit any of our offices for a physical meeting and documentation, signing\r\nand thumb prints.\r\n\r\n I would like to address a few points before finalizing the preparation and\r\ndelivery of the MOU. It would greatly help our process if you could provide\r\nme with more information regarding your loan request. Also, understanding\r\nthe intended purpose for the funds. It would be valuable for the content of\r\nthe MOU. Our networking remains the best and we are connected all over the\r\nworld with some big banks and we can give loans to any country in the\r\nworld. Our loan offer is the best (lowest) and unbelievable in the world\r\ntoday. AFTER THE BOARD MEETING TODAY, OUR OFFER GOES FROM 10 MILLION\r\n(MINIMUM) TO 1.5 billion (MAXIMUM) LIMIT. If there are any aspects of this\r\nmatter that seem unclear, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm readily\r\navailable to furnish you with any necessary details to ensure complete\r\nunderstanding. The process of releasing these funds is designed to be\r\nstraightforward and transparent.\r\n\r\nTo proceed, I kindly request again to confirm\r\n\r\n- Full name\r\n- A valid address that you would prefer to have included in the MOU.\r\n- Loan amount needed\r\n- Personal telephone number and also, attach any of your valid\r\nidentification\r\n\r\nOnce the MOU is reviewed, don't waste time, sign and return. I'll be able\r\nto provide you with the contact information of our Managing Director.\r\nRemember, there would be a physical meeting in any of our offices to sign\r\nand release your funds to you. Our MD would guide you through the\r\nsubsequent steps and offer further insights into this loan initiative. Our\r\ncommitment remains centered on providing you with exceptional service.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nCFO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback and also sorry for the late reply.

I have answered all your questions, you have to read it again\r\nand understand about our loan, if you are interested send me your details\r\ncomplete so I can forward it to our managing director Dr. John Saheed that\r\nis in charge of documentation and release of your loan funds. Our Mou\r\ncontains our loaSn procedures and everything about our loan, send me your\r\ncomplete details. You can read below and understand. I await you urgent\r\nresponse\r\n\r\n\r\n*READ THE THREE MAILS CAREFULLY, COMPLETE INFORMATION WILL BE ON THE MOU*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nThere would be an MOU that guides these loans, which would be sent to you.\r\nYou are to review, sign and return back to our managing director Dr. John\r\nSaheed on his official email address (johnsaheed@financemanagment.com).\r\nPlease kindly indicate the exact amount you are requesting for the loan.\r\nFirstly, these loans require a meeting in any of our offices which must\r\nhold for further discussion and signing of the loan documentation. Also,\r\nnote that the process is not strictly communicated by email, there must be\r\na physical meeting which would take place in any of our offices after which\r\nfunds would be disbursed to you. Without you coming for the physical\r\nmeeting, it will cost you because we would  recommend you to an attorney\r\nwho will stand for you, which is expensive. Our billionaire chairman do not\r\nlike it that way because of what is going on the internet and what is going\r\non in the world today, so no one will feel cheated which is why any of our\r\nclients needs to appear for the physical meeting, thumb prints,\r\ndocumentation signing and proceed together  to the bank for disbursement of\r\nyour loan funds to you which will happen same day if you arrive early. Be\r\ngood and smile because our billionaire chairman is globally connected with\r\nso many big banks and corresponding banks in the world, in which your loan\r\nfunds can be released once, bank draft or bit by bit depending on how you\r\nwant it released to you. The most important thing is the documentation and\r\nthe release is authentic and confirmable.\r\n\r\nYour information is being needed completely, because it stands as your\r\ncollateral. Please reconfirm\r\n\r\n- Full Name\r\n- Full address\r\n- Loan Amount Needed\r\n- Personal\\ WhatsApp telephone Number\r\n- Attach any copy of your valid identification (Passport or Driver's\r\nlicense)\r\n\r\nAs we said before, we are connected to various big banks all over the world\r\nand the corresponding bank is perfect, so there would never be any delay in\r\npayments. Our networking is wonderful and can never be compared with the\r\nrest of mind. I'm in charge of communication to inform our client to help\r\nthem understand our terms and guidelines for surrendering this loan before\r\ndirecting it to our managing director in charge. All our terms are simple,\r\nand collateral is straightforward which involves your full name, full\r\naddress, personal telephone number, and also the number you can reach on\r\nWhatsapp for the confidentiality guiding this loan. Our loan is 100% legit,\r\nwhich you would witness yourself in our various offices and bank\r\ntransactions so you have  nothing to worry about. We can transfer money\r\nanywhere in the world but if the loan is above $50 million would be split\r\nin batches. Again, our office can offer loans of 10 million (minimum) to 1\r\nbillion (maximum).\r\n\r\nCommunicating on the phone would commence as soon as the MOU has been\r\nsigned and sent back, our managing director Dr. John Saheed will\r\ncommunicate with you with his official email address and telephone number.\r\nThe information would be given to you as soon as the MOU is signed and\r\nreturned and you indicate the country you can travel to for the physical\r\nmeeting. We prefer meeting with our clients so they can witness the process\r\nof the loan, signing the documents themselves, all our clients are very\r\nhappy because we do not waste any of their time upon arrival. It takes a\r\nday process involving meetings in the morning at the office and at noon for\r\nthe bank release payments. Our clients can come in early and go back the\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\nIf you understand very well, then the next step is MOU. Please let me know\r\nif you need any clarification. In our previous emails, be informed that we\r\nhave our offices in Dubai, Netherland, London, Spain, Indonesia, Kuwait,\r\nBarren, Qatar or Turkey at which disbursement would be made. You are free\r\nto ask questions where you do not understand. Finally, if you are not\r\nbuoyant enough or capable of this loan you are free to refer someone who is\r\nwilling and capable, our loan remains the best with a 15 years grace and\r\nyou would manage it for 2years grace before the loan starts counting at\r\n1.5% Annual interest with the rest of mind. Get back to me with the details\r\nneeded, just go ahead and reconfirm please and also attach your\r\ninvestment\\project plan and whatsapp number where you can be reached and\r\nattach any of your valid identification. All our reconfirmation is to\r\nensure your details are correct and confirmed.

Your collateral is your address, a\r\nvalid identification and your personal telephone number and also the name\r\nyou wish to be in the MOU, either your personal or your company name.

Follow my instructions and reconfirm the details  if\r\nyou are interested in this loan and you will thank me later. Bank to bank\r\ntransfer without you appearing in any of our offices will cost you money\r\nupfront for clearance, that is why we made it mandatory for our client to\r\nvisit any of our offices for a physical meeting and documentation, signing\r\nand thumb prints.\r\n\r\n I would like to address a few points before finalizing the preparation and\r\ndelivery of the MOU. It would greatly help our process if you could provide\r\nme with more information regarding your loan request. Also, understanding\r\nthe intended purpose for the funds. It would be valuable for the content of\r\nthe MOU. Our networking remains the best and we are connected all over the\r\nworld with some big banks and we can give loans to any country in the\r\nworld. Our loan offer is the best (lowest) and unbelievable in the world\r\ntoday. AFTER THE BOARD MEETING TODAY, OUR OFFER GOES FROM 10 MILLION\r\n(MINIMUM) TO 1 billion (MAXIMUM) LIMIT. If there are any aspects of this\r\nmatter that seem unclear, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm readily\r\navailable to furnish you with any necessary details to ensure complete\r\nunderstanding. The process of releasing these funds is designed to be\r\nstraightforward and transparent.\r\n\r\nTo proceed, I kindly request again to confirm\r\n\r\n- Full name\r\n- A valid address that you would prefer to have included in the MOU.\r\n- Loan amount needed\r\n- Personal telephone number and also, attach any of your valid\r\nidentification\r\n\r\nOnce the MOU is reviewed, don't waste time, sign and return.

Is there another way we can continue our conversation?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSteven"
