        "body": "   My Dear Beneficiary ,\nI am sure this mail would be coming to you as a surprise since we have never met before and you would also be asking why I have decided to choose you among the numerous internet users in the world. Precisely, I cannot say why I have chosen you but do not be worried because I saw your profile on the Internet, which has made me accomplish my request. May the almighty God bless and see you through with this mission if you can carefully read and digest the message below.\nBefore I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography, I am Mother Emilly Alison, 67 Years old woman and the wife of Late Sir Jackman Alison who died in a Plane crash on Monday the 7th of September 1998 GMT 14:22 UK while they were flying from New York to Geneva.\nAfter the death of my husband I became the Head of his investment and now that I am old and weak I have decided to spend the rest of my life with my family in Turkey and loved ones whom I never had time for during the course of my business life, but before the death of my husband we had a plan to use the last days of our lives to donate half of what we have worked for to the less privileged and charity homes and the other half for ourselves, family members and close friends, and it is so unfortunate that my husband is not alive today to do this with me and I am very weak and old now, hence I have decided to do this philanthropic work on behalf of my late husband and I.\nPresently, I have willed out almost half of our assets to several charity homes and to some of the less privileged in different countries. Despite the agreement between my late husband and I to give aid to the deprived, we also agreed to render support to an individual we have not meet before in life due to the fact when we were still young in life we receive an anonymous help from an individual we did not know and which we have not being able to know till date, the impact we got from such gesture made us to do same.\nI am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know me because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I have agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the beneficiary of our last WILL, irrespective of your previous financial status, hence I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer that will cost you nothing.\nI have presently deposited a Cheque in the sum of 5,800,000.00 United States Dollars with PNC BANK New York for  bank  transfer to you, what you have to do now is to contact the  PNC BANK New York  as soon as possible for  bank transfer to you.\nI only made the deposit with your EMAIL ADDRESS and SECURITY KEEPING CODE  (KAT/0409/F) because I do not know your name and the address or your banking information you would want to receive the charity funds with. I couldn't find them on the net while browsing your profile. If not I would have given it to PNC BANK New York  for immediate  bank transfer into your bank account.\nFor your information, I have paid for the transfer Charge, Insurance Premium and Clearance Certificate Fee of the funds showing that it is not Drug Money or meant to sponsor Terrorist attack in your Country.\nLet me repeat again, try to contact them as soon as you receive this mail to avoid any further delay and remember to ask them to provide you with information on how they wish to receive their security keeping fee of $270.00 United States Dollars for their immediate action. Please my dear if you know that you will not help me with the $270.00 dollars please do not contact me or the PNC BANK New York  please i need some one that will help me.\nYou have to contact the  PNC BANK New York  now for the bank  transfer of the funds to you with this information below;\nCONTACT PERSON:  Mr. William Demchak ( CEO, PNC BANK New York )\nEmail:  \npncbankny2@gmail.com\nAgain, you are not to pay for the transfer Charge, the Insurance premium and the Clearance Certificate Fee of the funds because I have already paid for them, the only money you are expected to pay is 270 United States Dollars for the security keeping of the funds so far.\nI would have paid the fee but the company insisted that I should not because they don't know when you will be contacting them and to avoid demurrage or further cost.\nYou are to reconfirm the below information to them to avoid any mistake on the  information.\nPostal address;\nFull Names:\nDirect telephone number;\nBelow is the security keeping code: (KAT/0409/F) of the draft, you are to also present it to them for verification before  bank  transfer to you.\nNote: Please I do not want you to thank me or my late husband. All I need you to do is, When you get this fund, use ONLY 800.000.00 (Eight hundred thousand United States Dollars) for your effort and USE THE REST OF THIS FUND FOR CHARITY PURPOSE IN THE WAY IT WILL PLEASE HUMANITY.\nYours Faithfully\nMrs. Emilly Alison   "

        "body": "Hello Mrs. Emilly Alison,\n\nI'm truly touched by your story and the charitable work you're doing. It's not every day that one receives such a message, and I must say it's quite intriguing.\n\nHowever, I have a few questions if you don't mind. You mentioned that you found my profile on the internet, could you please tell me where exactly? Also, how did you decide to choose me for this generous offer?\n\nYou also mentioned about a cheque deposited with PNC BANK New York. Could you provide more details about this? How can I verify this information?\n\nLastly, regarding the security keeping fee of United States Dollars, could you explain why this fee is necessary and why it cannot be deducted from the funds directly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
