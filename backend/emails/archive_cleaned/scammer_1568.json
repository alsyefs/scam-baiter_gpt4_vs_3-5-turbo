Presently I'm in Paraguay for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I did not forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite the fact that you failed me somehow.\n \nContact and direct my secretary. Her Name is Miss. Mary Ubah Email:maryuba552@gmail.com  and Ask her to send you an International Bank Check from Royal Bank of Scotland $450.000.00 (Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand US Dollars) which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter.\n \nI appreciate your efforts at that time very much. So, feel free and get in touch with Miss. Mary Ubah and instruct her where to send the amount to you. Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the sufferings at that time. At the moment, I am very busy here because of the investment projects which I'm having with my new partner at hand.\n \nFinally, remember that I had forwarded instructions to my secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with her and she will send the amount to you without any delay.\n \nWith best regards,\nMr. Charles Obasi.\n(Sent From Paraguay)   "
