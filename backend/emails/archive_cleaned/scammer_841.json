        "body": "Hello Tony,\n\nThank you for reaching out and informing me about this situation. It's quite surprising to hear that my name was listed among those scammed, as I wasn't aware of it. \n\nI'm glad to know that measures are being taken to rectify the situation and that an amount of USD has been issued in ATM cards for the affected victims. However, I have a few questions regarding this process.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain how the ATM card system works? How will I be able to access the funds once I receive the card?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned a delivery fee of US dollars. Could you provide more details on why this fee is necessary and how it contributes to the delivery process?\n\nLastly, could you clarify what information is required from me at this stage? You mentioned occupation/profession and a copy of my ID but also stated not to give any personal information.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRyan"
