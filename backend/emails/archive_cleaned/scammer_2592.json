We\nhave never invested or managed any investment outside our region; this\nis a new opportunity and new market we are hoping to penetrate.\nAs one of our post COVD 19 strategies, we are currently seeking viable\ninvestment and projects globally, hopefully that can generate up to\n10% ROI. We are looking to invest purely on a loan/debt financing\nbasis of 3.5% interest annually.\nIf a debt financing is within acceptable funding requirements for\nprojects and investment opportunities under your umbrella, we will be\ninterested to further discuss such opportunity and possibilities for\npossible collaboration.\nKindly confirm the receipt of this email.\nSincere Regards,\nMr. Hassan le√†ndre Zoumara   "

I appreciate the information you have shared about your role as an investment consultant working under Dubai Holding. It sounds like you are looking for potential investment opportunities and projects globally.\n\nI'm curious to know more about the types of projects and businesses that Dubai Holding is interested in funding. Could you provide some examples or specific industries that you focus on? Additionally, what criteria do you consider when evaluating potential investments?\n\nFurthermore, could you please explain a bit more about the loan debt financing basis of interest annually? How does this work exactly, and what are the terms and conditions associated with it?\n\nThank you again for contacting me, and I look forward to learning more about your investment opportunities.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
