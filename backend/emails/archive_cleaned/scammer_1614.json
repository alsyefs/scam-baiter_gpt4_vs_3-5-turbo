How did you come across my name and why am I being considered for this?\n\nI'm really curious to know more about the Wealth Management Team and its operations. Also, could you explain a bit more about what ECOWAS Bank for Investment and EBID does?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
