        "body": "Hello Mrs. El Sy MME,\n\nThank you for your prompt response and the detailed explanation about the security measures in place for the funds. I must say, it's quite impressive to know that such high levels of insurance coverage are being maintained.\n\nI understand the urgency of the situation and I'm genuinely interested in this. However, could you please provide me with more information on why there is a fee involved? Also, could you clarify what exactly this fee is for?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
