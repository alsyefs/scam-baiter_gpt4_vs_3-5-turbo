        "body": "Hello Mr. Desmond Walter,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I don't recall having any interactions with a Mrs. Esther or Ms. Diane L., but it's possible that there may be some confusion.\n\nI'm not sure how my name got involved in this, but I would like to clarify a few things before we proceed further. Could you please provide more details about the fund transfer? How did Mrs. Esther come to choose me for this transaction?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the process of converting the fund into an ATM Master Card? That sounds interesting.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJill"
