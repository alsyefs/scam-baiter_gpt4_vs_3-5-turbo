        "body": "Hello Mr. John C, Obi,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected message. I'm not sure how the Monetary Fund IMF and Central Bank of Nigeria got my information, but it's interesting to know that there's an ATM card in my name.\n\nCould you please explain more about this? How did this come about? And why was I chosen for this?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a fee for the shipment of the ATM card. Could you provide more details on that? How much is it exactly?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
