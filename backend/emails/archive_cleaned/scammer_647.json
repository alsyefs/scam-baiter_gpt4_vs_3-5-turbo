I'm curious, could you please provide more details about these abandoned contracts? What kind of supplies are we talking about here?\n\nAlso, it's great to hear that Saudi Aramco oil will back up the lucky ones in the financial funding of the contract supplies. Could you elaborate on how this financial backing works?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarilyn"
