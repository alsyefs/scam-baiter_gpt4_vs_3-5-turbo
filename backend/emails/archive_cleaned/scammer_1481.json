        "body": "Hello Lawyer Larry,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your offer to transfer the funds into my account. However, before proceeding, I have a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1. Could you please provide more information about the fee for the transfer? What does it cover exactly?\n\n2. You mentioned accepting ITUNES GIFT CARD, GOOGLE PLAY CARD, STEAM GIFT CARD, or AZON GIFT CARD as payment. Is there a specific reason why these gift cards are preferred over other forms of payment?\n\n3. Can you explain how sending the fee via email works? Is there a specific email address I should use?\n\n4. In regards to the Bitcoin wallet you mentioned, could you provide more details on how to send the fee using this method?\n\nI look forward to your response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrank"
