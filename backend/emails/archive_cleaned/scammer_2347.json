It's indeed a tragic event.\n\nI'm quite intrigued by the information you've shared, especially about your client sharing almost the same name as mine. I'd like to know more about this coincidence. Could you please share more details about him? What was his full name?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about his work as a CEO of a textile company and a miner at Kruger mining company. It sounds like he had an interesting career. Could you tell me more about his professional life?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMatthew"
