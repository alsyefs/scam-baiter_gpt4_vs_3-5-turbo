        "body": "Hello Mr. Kenny,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the outcome of the meeting at the United Nations. I appreciate you informing me about my two trunk boxes that have been withheld at John Glenn Columbus Airport.\n\nI'm glad to hear that the United Nations and the World Bank have approved the release of my trunk boxes. It's quite intriguing to know that each box contains a significant amount of cash funds. However, before proceeding further, I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nCould you please provide more details about why my trunk boxes were withheld in the first place? Additionally, what are the necessary steps I need to take in order to claim my trunk boxes? Lastly, could you explain why I would need to come down to the airport personally or use a courier delivery company?\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
