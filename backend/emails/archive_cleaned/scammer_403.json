        "body": "Dear Beneficiary Mr. Rolando,\r\n\r\nThank for your response, mean while i am Mr. Christian Rowland from fund\r\nrecovery unit, and a meeting was held last week regarding a compensation\r\nfund awarded to scam victims and non victims, the UNITED NATION (NU) and\r\nthe PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITIES (PA) has passed new bill that no private\r\nbeneficiary payment will be approved which means only scam victims and non\r\nvictims and cooperate body payments are approved.\r\n\r\nMean while they have stated that the beneficiaries are mandated to travel\r\ndown to their office in UN office Africa to present his or her  files\r\nbefore they will release or compensate the beneficiary, but the good news\r\nis that I have already hired an attorney who represent you to the\r\nconference meeting to enable the presidential office approve your file and\r\nrelease your payment.\r\n\r\nNote: the UNITED NATION and PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITIES has decided to help\r\nall the name listed to recover all the money they have lost in order to\r\nreceive your inheritance fund even if you are not a scam victim you will be\r\nentitled to receive the payment since your name and email appeared to their\r\nfiles and they have decided to register your name as one of the Social\r\nCultural Alliance (SCA) Member and your work is to stand as their financial\r\nmember. Your monthly payment will last only for 2years then your contract\r\nwith them will expired. Remember you will be receiving from their office\r\nthe sum of usd$34,690 every month for your compensation fund which will\r\nlast only for 2years with them, so that is the only way they have choosing\r\nto pay all that have lost money in the hands of african scammers.\r\n\r\nSo please if this is OK by you then you have to respond back to me with\r\nyour FULL NAME/MOBILE PHONE/ HOUSE ADDRESS so that I will let you know the\r\nnext step, so upon your response then I will update you on what is needed\r\nto proceed regarding this great opportunity.\r\n\r\nI am waiting to hear from you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nFor more inquiry, reply me with this email address(chistrowland12@gmail.com)\r\nand i will get back to you.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nFrom: Christian Rowland\r\nchistrowland12@gmail.com\n-------------------------"

Your payment will last only two years and there is no\r\nway they can change the amount because of you, because some individuals\r\nhave received their payment  the same amount as yours.\r\nNo 4:Due to the experience we had last year by one of the victim who\r\ncouldn't defend herself during the conference meeting last year when asked\r\nwhat he will use this money for and while is she here, and she couldn't\r\ndefend herself, she was left behind and was sent back and until now her\r\nfiles remain dormant. We now decided to hire an attorney to stand for you\r\nsince you can not travel out for personal and health issues as it was\r\ntagged to your file documents. I hope I have cleared your question?\r\n\r\nNow what is needed from you is to reconfirm your:\r\n\r\nFULL NAME\r\nMOBILE PHONE\r\nHOUSE ADDRESS.\r\n\r\nFor proper documentation while you respond to the next options to get these\r\nfunds to your possession.\r\n\r\nI am waiting to hear from you as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nFor more inquiry, reply to me with this email address(\r\nchistrowland12@gmail.com) and i will get back to you.\r\n\r\nSincerely\r\nFrom: Christian Rowland\r\nchistrowland12@gmail.com\n-------------------------"

Could you tell me more about this organization? What does becoming a financial member entail?\n\nThe idea of receiving monthly funds for two years sounds very appealing. However, I'm curious about the process. How exactly will these funds be transferred or delivered to me?\n\nYou mentioned an unfortunate incident with a previous victim who couldn't defend herself during a conference meeting. That sounds like quite an ordeal! If I may ask, what kind of questions are typically asked at these meetings? And how would hiring an attorney help in this situation?\n\nLastly, you asked for my full name, mobile phone number and house address. While I understand that this information might be necessary for the process, I'm afraid I can't provide them at this time due to privacy concerns.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRolando"
