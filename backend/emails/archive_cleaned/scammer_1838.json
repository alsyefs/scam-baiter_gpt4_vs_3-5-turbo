While going through beneficiaries'/contractors' files\nyesterday, I came across your own file and discovered that the major\nreason why you have not received your fund for the  past years is\nbecause you are not the real contractor who executed this contract.\nAnd  if you continue to fight to receive this fund it will be\nimpossible for you to get it.\nBased on that fact, I want you and I to strike a deal so that if you\nare ready to receive the fund, I will guide you on the necessary\nthings to be done so that you will receive this fund. If you keep\ntrying on your own to claim this fund they will need you to get the\nvital documents from the original contractor that backs up this fund.\nBut I want to make it much easier for you if you can accept to work\nwith me so that I will make it possible for you to receive this fund.\nThe total amount in question is USD$26.5M. So if you are ready to work\nwith me, I need you to provide your full information to me such as\nyour full names, address, phone and any of your identification card.\nOn receipt of those information from you, I will tell you the next\nstep.\nYou can also call me on the phone number: +234-9165637153.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nMr. Yemi Cardoso\nCentral Bank Governor.\n+234-9165637153.

        "body": "Hello Mr. Yemi Cardoso,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing! I'm not sure how my name got mixed up in all of this, but it sounds like an interesting situation.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about this contract? I don't recall ever being involved in any such thing. Also, could you clarify what you mean by \"vital documents from the original contractor\"?\n\nI'm also curious about the role of the Central Bank in this matter. How does the bank usually handle situations like these?\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nElma"
