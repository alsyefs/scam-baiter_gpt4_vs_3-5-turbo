It's good to know that the Monetary Fund IMF is now directly in charge of my payment.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please explain more about how this payment schedule works? And why are there only two transfers in a year?\n\nAlso, I noticed you mentioned a CODE. What exactly is this code used for and how do I use it?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDustin"
