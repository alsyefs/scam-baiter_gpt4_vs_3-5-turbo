        "body": "Dear Beloved Friend\nRE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND\nAfter waiting to hear from you or your Ghana partner for a long time\nnow, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution\nin other not to let it be if I have anything in mind against you. I do\nnot know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this\nfund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one\nproblem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or\nyou do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.\nSome time ago, your Ghanaian friends, I mean the people that introduced\nyou to the project approached me through my dear wife who works with the\nFederal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them conclude a\nmoney transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them\nby removing the original contractor’s name, company’s name and bank\nparticulars from the Bank of Ghana vetting computer and replacing them\nwith your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the\nrightful beneficiary of this fund.\nI agreed on the condition that they will pay me US$100,000.00 as soon as\nyour name appears as the beneficiary\n. I did as agree and demanded to be\npaid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you\npromised to send money to me.\nDo you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from\nthem and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude,\nI decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied\nmy right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my\njob.  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute\nany contract in Ghana, although I am the only person privileged to know\nthis information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is\nthat I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude\nthis project. Now I am ready to forget the past.\nI do not need the US $100.000.00 any longer from you but a good\ncompensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues\nwill be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them\nare aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money\nunnecessarily to Bank of Ghana Officers both here and overseas because\nyou will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did\nthe work at the beginning and only I can perform it. Finally,\nI need your promise that no official of the Bank of Ghana will be aware\nof my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure\nme that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my\nwife to establish a foreign account in your country where my\ncompensation will be lodged.  Also, a TT FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS\nwill be sent to you for endorsement after which I will remit the money\nwithin 48 hours.\nI am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with\nme, kindly contact me by mail so that we can have a chat over this issue\nonce and for all.  But if the reverse is the case, do not bother\nyourself to reach me and forget about this money.\nBEST REGARDS\nDr.Kwame Owusu-Nyantekyi"

It seems like you've been through a lot with this situation. \n\nI'm curious about a few things though. You mentioned that my Ghanaian friends approached you through your wife who works at the Federal Ministry of Finance. Could you tell me more about how that happened? Also, could you explain what exactly the \"TT FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS\" are?\n\nI appreciate your honesty in sharing all these details with me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nHarry"
