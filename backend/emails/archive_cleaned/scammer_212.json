        "body": "Hello Sandy Oritz, Jr.,\n\nThank you for your message. I'm thrilled to hear about the transfer of such a large sum into my bank account. However, I must admit that I'm a bit confused about this Security Payment Code Number (SPCN) you mentioned.\n\nCould you please explain more about what this SPCN is? How does it work and why is it so important for the transfer? Also, could you provide me with some guidance on how to contact Mr. Ernest Addison at the Bank of Ghana?\n\nI appreciate your patience and assistance in this matter.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLuis"
