Your proposal sounds interesting and I'm intrigued by the opportunity to work with NORMONZ COMPANY UK. \n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please provide more details about the seed oil that your company requires? What kind of seed oil is it exactly? Also, could you elaborate on what the role of a local dealer entails?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
