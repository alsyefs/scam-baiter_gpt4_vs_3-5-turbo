        "body": "Hello Vivian F. Doglas,\n\nThank you for your message and the exciting news about my winnings! I can't believe I've won such a large amount from the Olympic, UEFA Champions League, and Coca Cola Lotto. This is truly a surprise!\n\nI'm curious to know more about this process. How was I selected as the winner? And could you please explain more about this ATM Visa Card that has been credited with my prize money?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a fee for the claim. Could you provide more details on what this fee is for? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKatherine"
