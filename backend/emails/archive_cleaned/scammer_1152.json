        "body": "Hello Barrister James Adams,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate incident involving your late client, Engr. Albert Robert. It's always sad when someone passes away without any next of kin to carry on their legacy.\n\nYour proposal is quite intriguing, I must say. However, I have a few questions before we proceed further. Could you please provide more details about Engr. Albert Robert? What was his profession and how did he amass such wealth?\n\nAlso, could you explain the process of claiming this fund in more detail? I'm not very familiar with legal procedures and would appreciate if you could simplify it for me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJena"
