        "body": "  Hello Dear,\nSorry to invade your privacy, I am Mrs. Esther George, the widow of an engineer, George Hanalee. I am 60 years old and have long term esophageal cancer. Doing business and making money was our priority, and we didn't care much about others. But since my husband passed away during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and our many years of marriage were not blessed with children, I have found a new desire to help orphans living in orphanages/mothers/women/refugees and foster families.\nWhen my late husband was alive, we deposited US$10,000,000.00 in a HSBC Bank, United State, in the country where my husband worked. I am in a hospital receiving treatment for esophageal cancer, and the doctor diagnosed me and secretly told me what to expect to create the inevitable spirit. He says that because of the rapid growth and the tremendous pain it causes, I may not live more than six months. My last wish is to donate this money to charity because my family and friends robbed me of my possessions because of my illness. I can't live with the pain and leave this great responsibility to any of them. I decided to give $10 million usd for the development of the community and helping the less privileged. I chose you after visiting the site, having prayed on it.\nPlease, in the name of God, accept the money deposited in my late husband's name and use it to help the less privileged. You can email me at: [esthergeorge1@myself.com] for more information May God grace and blessings be with you and your family,\nYours Sister and friend,\nMrs. Esther George   "
