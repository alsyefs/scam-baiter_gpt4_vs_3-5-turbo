It's not every day that one receives such news!\n\nI have a few questions, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about what this contract award winning payment is? How was I selected for this? And what does it mean that the United Nations is involved?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about Mr. Carlos Lait Fin? What is his role in all of this?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nHenry"
