Can you please provide me with more details about the largesse you mentioned? How much are we talking about, and how would you like me to distribute it among charitable homes?\n\nAlso, could you tell me a bit more about your attorney and how they found my information online? I just want to make sure everything is legitimate before proceeding.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nRalph"
