It's interesting to learn about the various unclaimed benefits that are being managed by the Monetary Fund IMF.\n\nI'm curious, how does this process of releasing funds through an online system of banking work? And what role does the Technology Department play in this?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
