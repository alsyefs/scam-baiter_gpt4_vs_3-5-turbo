        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the US Santander Bank Head Office. I appreciate the quick notice regarding my funds transfer. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about why the funds will go back to the Government Treasure account as unclaimed? Is there a specific deadline that I need to meet in order to prevent this from happening?\n\nAdditionally, I'm curious about why you are requesting payment through iTunes cards or Steam wallet gift cards. Is there a particular reason for this method of payment? How does it ensure a secure and efficient transfer of funds into my bank account?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDouglas"
