        "body": "Dear Ugo Frank,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the payment of my fund. I appreciate the efforts of the present government in Nigeria to fight against corruption and improve the country's reputation.\n\nI am interested in receiving my funds, but I have a few questions before proceeding. Could you please provide more details about the process of the BANK to BANK ONLINE WIRE TRANSFER? How long does it usually take for the funds to be transferred? Are there any fees or charges associated with this method?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know more about the ATM card option. How does it work exactly? Can I use it internationally? Are there any limitations or restrictions on withdrawing funds from an ATM machine?\n\nLastly, could you please clarify what information you require from me in order to proceed with either method of payment? I want to ensure that everything is done correctly and securely.\n\nThank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nClay"
