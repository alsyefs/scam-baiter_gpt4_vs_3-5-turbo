        "body": "Hello Mr. Kenny,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about the two trunk boxes. It's quite fascinating to hear about these meetings at the United Nations and World Bank, I had no idea such things were discussed there!\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in relation to these boxes? And why are they being held at John Glenn Columbus Airport? I don't recall having any business or transactions that would result in such a large amount of cash being stored in two trunks.\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about what the inspection process involves? It sounds like a very important job!\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPeggy"
