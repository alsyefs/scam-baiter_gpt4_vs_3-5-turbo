        "body": "Hello Steven Green,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it's not every day that one receives an email like this. \n\nI'm curious about the process you've described. Could you please explain more about what an apex non-appearance form is? Also, how does someone help me sign my documents? Is there a specific person assigned for this task?\n\nI'm also interested in knowing more about the Standard Chartered Bank's operations in South Africa. How long have you been working there and how has your experience been so far?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nDeanna"
