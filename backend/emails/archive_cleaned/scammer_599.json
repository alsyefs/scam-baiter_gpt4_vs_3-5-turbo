        "body": "Hello Mr. Nicolas de Rivi re,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my contract fund. I appreciate the update on the payment process. However, I have a few questions before I proceed further.\n\n1. Could you please provide more details about the RAW GOLD AND CASH Diplomat? How can I be sure that this person is authorized to handle my funds?\n\n2. Is there a specific reason why I should not disclose the content of the TRUNK BOXES to the Diplomat? What measures are in place to ensure the safety and security of my funds?\n\n3. Can you please explain why you require my home address, direct telephone number, and a copy of my ID? What will these be used for?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
