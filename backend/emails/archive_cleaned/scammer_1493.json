        "body": "Hello Martin Navarro,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite surprising to hear about this change of account from Mr. Julius Fletcher. I must admit, I don't recall endorsing any such changes recently.\n\nCould you please provide more details about when and how this change was requested? Also, could you clarify the relationship between Mr. Julius Fletcher and myself that would allow him to make such a request?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobin"
