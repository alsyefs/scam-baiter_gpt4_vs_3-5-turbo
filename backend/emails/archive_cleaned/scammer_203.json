        "body": "Hello Mr. David R. Malpass,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the funds transfer. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about this large sum of money.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in relation to these funds? And could you please explain more about the Fund Legality and Bulk Money Transfer Permit? I'm not very familiar with these terms.\n\nAlso, I noticed that Mrs. Annette Cang's name was mentioned several times in your message. Could you tell me more about her role in this process?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMonica"
