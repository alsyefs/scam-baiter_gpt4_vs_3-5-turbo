        "body": "Hello Mrs. Margrethe Vestager,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the recovery of funds. I appreciate your efforts in addressing this matter. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, I am not familiar with Mr. Qu Risheng from China. I do not have a brother by that name either. Could you please provide more information about his claim and how he is connected to my payment file?\n\nSecondly, I did not sign any Deed of Assignment in favor of Mr. Qu Risheng or anyone else. It seems there may be some confusion or misunderstanding here. Can you clarify why this change of account has been requested and what steps can be taken to rectify the situation?\n\nLastly, you mentioned that the only fee required to receive my payment is an iTunes Gift Card, Apple Gift Card, Steam Gift Card, or Google Play Gift Card for the Ownership Internal Revenue Tax. Can you explain why these specific gift cards are necessary for the payment process? Is there no alternative method available?\n\nI look forward to your prompt response and appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
