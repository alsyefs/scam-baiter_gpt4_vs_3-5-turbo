It seems like there is some confusion regarding a box of funds that belongs to me. I assure you that I am very much alive and interested in learning more about this matter.\n\nCould you please provide me with some additional details? What exactly is the purpose of these funds? How did they come into my possession? And how can I ensure their safe delivery?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in clarifying these matters. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
