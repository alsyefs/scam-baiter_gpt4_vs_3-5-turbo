This is to tell you that the Scotland Yard Police, Interpol, Federal Bureau of Investigation, (FBI) of United States of America, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) of Nigeria and all the African Crime fighter leaders have come together to stop scam/internet fraud in Nigeria and all around Africa. We have recovered over $5.3 Billion US Dollars from the people we have behind bars.\nOur duty is to make sure we stop Internet scam and money laundering. As for today we have put a lot of fraudsters in jail. We go all over Africa to pick these thieves/Internet rats. We have over 18,273 of them in our jails around Africa and we are still looking for more. We are aware that a lot of foreigners out there have been deceived and lost their hard earn money to these fraudsters after promising them percentages in their letters/e-mails for their impending help to move funds out of Africa including fake lottery winning notification and at the end of the day, they will collect thousands of dollars from you without a successful end. It was agreed that to retain the good image of Nigeria and the rest of African countries, all the victims who lost his/her hard earn money to these faceless thieves will be compensated with just $10M (Ten Million US Dollars Only). This we assume will help you start a new life. Please, you have to accept the money like that because the people (victims) in our pay list are too much\nTHIS IS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR DIPLOMAT HAS ARRIVED WITH YOUR CONSIGNMENT BOXES AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CALIFORNIA USA.

        "body": "Hello Dr. Olayemi Michael Cardoso,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. It's great to hear about the efforts being made to combat internet fraud in Nigeria and across Africa. I'm glad to know that such actions are being taken to protect innocent people from scams.\n\nI'm intrigued by the mention of a diplomat arriving in Los Angeles with boxes for me. Could you please provide more details about these boxes? What do they contain? And why were they sent to me?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by reconfirming my full name, airport, and valid phone? I'm not sure I understand what this process involves.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nNicole"
