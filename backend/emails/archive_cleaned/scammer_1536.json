        "body": "Hello Ahlenius,\n\nThank you for reaching out and informing me about this situation. It's quite surprising to hear that I've been listed as a victim of such an unfortunate circumstance. \n\nI'm curious, how was my name mentioned by the syndicate? And could you please provide more details about these meetings held at Abuja, Nigeria? It would be interesting to know more about what was discussed.\n\nAlso, could you elaborate on the payment process? You mentioned several options for receiving payments. What are these options?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCruz"
