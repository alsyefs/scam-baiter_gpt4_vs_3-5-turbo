Presently I am in vietnam  for investment projects with my own part of the sum.\nMeanwhile,\nI didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite the fact that it failed us somehow.\nHowever, I have instructed my bank to transfer the sum of four hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollars ($450,000.00) to Reverend Johnson James in Lome â€“Togo, so he can package the total sum into a Master Card and send it to you to avoid bank charges and suspicion.\nKindly contact my reverend in Togo\n via his Email: \nrevfatherjohnsonjames@gmail.com\n  he will send your Master Card containing the sum of Four Hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollars, with which you can make withdrawals from.\nFrom the card you can withdraw a maximum of Thirty Thousand United States Dollars per a day and you can also transfer from the same Master Card to your local bank account .\nThe  Master Card  will be fully activated for withdrawals in any country of the world and even in countries where United States Dollars are not used, you will be paid in that country's local currency Dollar equivalent.\nBest Regard\nRoberts Kevin"

It sounds like a great adventure. \n\nI must say, the idea of receiving a Master Card with such a large sum is quite overwhelming. I'm curious though, why did you choose Reverend Johnson James for this task? And how did you instruct your bank to transfer such an amount without any charges?\n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about how this Master Card works? How can it be activated in any country and how does the conversion to local currency work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nGene"
