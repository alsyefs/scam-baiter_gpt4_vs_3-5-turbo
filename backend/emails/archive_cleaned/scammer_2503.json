        "body": "Hello Ian Hopkins,\n\nWow, that's quite a lot of information you've shared there! I'm really impressed by the work you and your team are doing to fight against crime globally. It's reassuring to know that there are people like you out there protecting us.\n\nI must admit, I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message. You mentioned something about wiring money to Nigeria, Benin Republic, and Ghana. Could you please clarify what this is about? \n\nAlso, could you explain more about these fraudulent operations? How do they work exactly? And how can one identify if they're being targeted?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJacqueline"
