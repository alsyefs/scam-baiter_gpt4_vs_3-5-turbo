It's really reassuring to know that the United States Government and the United Nations are looking out for people like me.\n\nI'm curious though, how did you manage to get hold of these scammers? And how did they have my information in the first place? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this ATM Visa card Payment method? I've never heard of it before. Is it safe and secure?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSherman"
