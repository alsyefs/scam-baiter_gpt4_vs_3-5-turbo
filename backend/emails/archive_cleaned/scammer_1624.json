        "body": "  FROM UNITED NATIONS AUDITOR\nHI\nHow many times do I have to send warning emails  before you can listen to me and stop communicating with all those banks, bitcoins and atm card departments claiming they have PERMITS AND APPROVAL from the United Nations to finalize a TRANSACTION in your name? no banks will be permitted or allowed to carry out a transaction for any beneficiary approved by the UNITED NATIONS, Because they have proven to be incapable to handle FUNDS sincerely without issues of DIVERTED FUNDS or EXCESS REQUEST for fees. Beneficiaries have sent hundreds of emails and text messages to UNITED NATIONS with complaints of not receiving funds via the said BANKS OR DIPLOMATS.\nThe safe united box online banking was created to put a stop to beneficiary harassment by the banks and diplomats, The safe bank is only monitored for a safe transfer, which means that once you pay THE IMF SORT CODE , a CODE WILL BE GENERATED AND EMAILED TO YOU by the IMF? Not even the ACCOUNT OFFICER will have access to your code, If only you had followed this simple instructions and obtained the IMF CODE, No one will ever harass you to send any form of payment after the IMF CODE is emailed to you, Why not sacrifice just 24 hours and work with the SAFE BANK OFFICIALS in resolving your transaction approval and funding.\nPlease don't miss this opportunity for anything in this world, Yes I know it's difficult to trust and try again, Remember that REWARDS COME IN DISGUISE MOST TIMES AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE ABOUT TO GIVE UP. Work directly with the UNITED NATIONS CREATED BANK FOR YOUR TRANSACTION APPROVAL AND FUNDING 100% GUARANTEED AND ASSURED.\nYOU WILL DEFINITELY THANK ME LATER\nGET BACK TO ME IMMEDIATELY IF YOU CAN FOR THE CORRECT EMAIL ADDRESS OF THE SAFE UN BOX ONLINE BANK  \nMike Bernard   "

        "body": "Hi Mike Bernard,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your concern about the banks, bitcoins, and ATM card claims. It's interesting to hear that the United Nations has created a safe online banking system to prevent harassment and ensure safe transfers. Can you provide more information about how this system works? How can I obtain the IMF code you mentioned? I'm curious to learn more about this alternative approach.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nPamela"
