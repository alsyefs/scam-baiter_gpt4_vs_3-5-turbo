        "body": "Hello Ms. Angela Yayra Kwashie,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite concerning to hear about these reports of individuals being asked to pay irrelevant charges by various officials and agencies. I'm glad to know that the United Nations and IMF are taking steps to address this issue.\n\nCould you please elaborate more on what exactly the Anti Terrorism Department does in these situations? And how does the process of certification by the Anti Terrorism Department work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKim"
