I'm really looking forward to getting in touch with Joseph Daniel at Western Union.\n\nCould you please tell me more about this process? Like, how did my fund get released and why is it being transferred through Western Union? Also, what does activating my account file mean?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions. I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nThank you so much for your help!\n\nBest wishes,\nMartin"
