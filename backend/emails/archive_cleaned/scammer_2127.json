I must admit, I'm a bit surprised as I don't recall having any pending funds with An Empire Management Finance.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this? How did my name come up in your records? And could you explain a bit more about the choice Mode of Payment?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSteve"
