There's a DRC (Deposit Release\nCase) which is open in a Security company vault because the owner\nis now deceased and there's no clear next of kin to inherit or\nclear the deposit.\nAs a stock consultant working with the Security Company, I\nnoticed that the deposit did not have proper details registered.\nI propose that we work together to clear the deposit as I am very\nsure it is a deposit with very high value because of the name of\nthe depositor.\nThis is totally 100% risk-free and would be mutually beneficial.\nThat's all the detail I can provide for now until I receive your\npositive reply and I can explain further.\nRegards,\nMr. Jones Jimmy Harra.\nSend your reply to my private email \nharrajimmy6@gmail.com\n "
