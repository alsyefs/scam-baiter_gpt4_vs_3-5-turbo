        "body": " Attn: Sir/Madam,\nMy name is Yemi Cardoso.  I am the new  governor of Central Bank of Nigeria.  While going through beneficiaries'/contractors' files yesterday, I came across your own file and discovered that the major reason why you have not received your fund for the past years is because you are not the real contractor who executed this contract.  And if you continue to fight to receive this fund it will be impossible for you to get it.\nBased on that fact, I want you and I to strike a deal so that if you are ready to receive the fund, I will guide you on the necessary things to be done so that you will receive this fund.  If you keep trying on your own to claim this fund they will need you to get the vital documents from the original contractor that backs up this fund.  But I want to make it much easier for you if you can accept to work with me so that I will make it possible for you to receive this fund.\nThe total amount in question is USD$26.5M.  So if you are ready to work with me, I need you to provide your full information to me such as your full names, address, phone and any of your identification card.  On receipt of those information from you, I will tell you the next step.\nPlease you should be informed that I will provide all the necessary documents that will back up this fund so that after you receive this fund there will be no agency that will question you about the source of this fund.  I also want to ask you if you can be able to come down here to sign all those documents.  But if you know you cannot be able to come down here to sign the documents, a competent lawyer here will sign  those documents on your behalf and the lawyer will charge the sum of $250 for him to sign those documents for you which you will be the person to pay this fee because you will be required to send a copy of the receipt of payment of this $250.  That is the only fee you will pay and nothing again to pay before you receive this fund.\nPlease note that this is a deal between you and I and I want you to cooperate with me.\nPlease you should reply this to this email address: \ncardosoyemi11@mail.ee\nYou can also call me on the phone number: +234-9165637153.\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nYemi Cardoso\nNew Central Bank Governor.\nE-mail: \ncardosoyemi11@mail.ee\n "

        "body": "Hello Yemi Cardoso,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your offer to help me receive the fund that has been pending for years. It's interesting that you came across my file and discovered the reason behind the delay.\n\nI would like to know more about how we can proceed with this deal. Could you please provide me with some additional information? Specifically, I would like to understand the steps involved in receiving the fund and what documents are required from my end.\n\nAdditionally, I am curious about why it is necessary for me to provide my full name, address, phone number, and card details. How will this information be used in the process?\n\nRegarding signing the documents, unfortunately, I won't be able to come down there personally. However, if a competent lawyer can handle it on my behalf, I would be open to that option. Could you please share more details about the lawyer's role and their fee?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
