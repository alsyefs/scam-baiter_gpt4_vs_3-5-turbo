I sincerely and deliberately seek your consent to present you as the next of kin / will beneficiary to the deceased so that the sum valued at £19.1 Million British Pounds Sterling will be transferred to you, which will be shared in these percentage ratio:  50% for me and 40% to you respectively while 10% is for any expenses incurred during the transaction.\nI need your sincere cooperation, trust and utmost confidentiality to enable us to conduct this transaction successfully. I assure and promise you that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law both in your country and here in London as the fund is transferred to your nominated bank account.

        "body": "Hello Mr. Donald Bliss,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I must say, your letter certainly caught my attention! It's not every day that one receives news of such a large sum of money.\n\nThe story about Mr. David Brown is quite tragic, it's always sad to hear about such accidents. I'm curious though, how did you come across my contact information? And why have you chosen me for this matter?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the process? How does it work exactly? I'm not very familiar with banking procedures and would appreciate some clarification.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDouglas"
