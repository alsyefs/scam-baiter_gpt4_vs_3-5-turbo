        "body": "Dear Mr. Austin Donaldson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing this important information. I appreciate your efforts in combating fraudsters and scam artists in Africa. It's good to know that actions are being taken to bring them to justice.\n\nI must admit, though, that I am a bit surprised to receive this email. I wasn't aware that my email address was found in the file of a scam artist. Could you please provide me with more details about how my email address ended up there? I want to make sure that my personal information is secure.\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about the process of receiving the ATM Card. How long does it usually take for the card to be delivered through Express Mail Service? And are there any fees or charges associated with receiving and using the card?\n\nThank you once again for your assistance, Mr. Donaldson. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
