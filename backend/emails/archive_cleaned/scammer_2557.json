We have signed and  sealed all the\npapers related to this delivery to you that we should return this atm\ncard worth $10.5m to the Federal Treasury Department. I am no more waiting\nfor you for this delivery but bear it in mind that if you still want\nthis atm card to be delivered to your house that you should rush now\nand send this last fee of $50 and have your ATM card delivered to you.\nFailure to send the fees today, then forget about this ATM card\nbecause by tomorrow, it will be government own. Do not blame me for\nanything as i have waited too much.\nIf you are blocked from using western union or money gram then go and\nbuy iTunes card and send. Make sure you do it today if you really want\nyour ATM card but failure to do it today then you will lose your\nfunds. I have tried and can not continue waiting or writing you day by\nday\nI swear If I fail to release your payment after you send the $50.00 as\nI promise don't count on me again, I cannot fail you, I promise you\ndonâ€™t fear as soon as you send the $50.00 today please leave the rest\nto me and see if I am lying to you because I can not use my life swear\nbecause of $50.00, how can I swear against my life because of this\nsmall amount? it is to show you that I am telling you the truth.\nSo \nyou are advised to go right now to the Walmart and get me\nSteam card of $50 so that i can proceed and get\neverything done Asap\nI promise you as soon as I hear from you with the payment of $50 Apple\ngift card or Steam card. Today i shall send your pick up information\nthe same day you send the $50.00 Steam wallet card or iTunes card I swear to God\nYours Faithfully,\nMr. David Larry  "

        "body": "Hello Mr. David Larry,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information about the ATM card. I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. Can you please provide me with more details about the purpose of this card and how it is connected to the Federal Treasury? I want to make sure I understand everything correctly before taking any further steps.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify why there is a need for me to purchase a Steam card or Apple gift card? How does that relate to the delivery of the ATM card? I just want to ensure that I have all the necessary information before proceeding.\n\nThank you again for your assistance in this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nHouston"
