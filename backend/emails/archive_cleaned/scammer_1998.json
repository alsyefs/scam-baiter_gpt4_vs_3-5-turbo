It's quite peculiar that someone named Gilbert would claim otherwise.\n\nAs for the delivery fee, it's interesting that it can be paid through an Apple gift card, Steam Wallet or Bitcoin. Could you please explain why these specific methods are preferred? \n\nAlso, could you provide more details about this CLEAN BILL OF RECORD? What exactly does it entail and why is it necessary for the delivery of my fund?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nHarold"
