        "body": "Hello Mr. Koskinen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the situation. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about this box containing such a large sum of money. \n\nI'm curious though, how did my email address get selected for this Coca Cola Company award? I don't recall participating in any lottery or contest recently.\n\nAlso, regarding the woman who claimed to be my sister, could you provide more details about her? It's quite alarming that someone would try to claim something on my behalf without my knowledge.\n\nLastly, could you explain why I need to purchase a Steam Wallet Gift Card or Amazon card? How does it relate to getting the box delivered to me?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRuby"
