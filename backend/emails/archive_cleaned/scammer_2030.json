        "body": "Hello Ms. April Talintyre,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me about this matter. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear that there are funds waiting for me! I'm curious though, how did my name come up as one of those yet to be paid off? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the offshore online bank account? It sounds interesting but I'm not very familiar with these things. How does it work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
