        "body": "Hello Brad Smith,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe it. I'm so grateful for your help in this matter. \n\nJust to clarify, the funds are coming in a secured box through a courier service, right? That sounds very secure and professional. And you mentioned that we're sharing the proceeds equally, which seems fair to me.\n\nI'm really looking forward to receiving the tracking details so I can follow the package's journey. It's going to be like waiting for Christmas morning!\n\nAs for my address, I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable sharing it over email. Is there another way we could arrange the delivery?\n\nThank you again for all your help.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
