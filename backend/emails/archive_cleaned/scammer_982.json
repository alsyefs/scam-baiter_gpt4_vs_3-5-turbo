        "body": "Dear  Ralph\r\n\r\nThanks for your mail, how are you and your health? Itâ€™s the will of God to\r\nknow you in this transaction. I am a senior staff in Foreign Trade bank\r\nhere in Cambodia; I have been a banker for 27 years now. I have had a\r\nclient for years and I control his account here in Foreign Trade bank,\r\nunfortunately his family was involved in the tsunami disaster on the 26\r\nDecember 2004 in Sumatra Indonesia where they all lost their lives.\r\n\r\nBased on this incident he started sick for years and developed heart\r\nproblems and passed away on 12th march 2005 leaving nobody as the next of\r\nkin. On his sick bed I am the only person that controls his hospital bills\r\nbecause I am in control of his money being his personal accountant.\r\n\r\nAfter years of the fund $32,640,000 (Thirty Two Million Six Hundred and\r\nForty Thousand United States Dollars) here in Foreign Trade bank none of\r\nthe family was alive for the claims, recently Foreign Trade bank board\r\ndirectors stipulate to send this money to the government treasury purse. I\r\nam a living witness of this fund which I will not like the government to\r\nhave together with his estate. I decided to contact you to stand as the\r\nrelative next of kin because you share the same name with him.\r\n\r\nAfter my research I got your contact information from a reputable\r\nbusiness/professional directory of your country which gives me assurance of\r\nyour legibility as a person while trying to get a good and capable business\r\nfor both business and investment purposes.\r\n\r\nAll documents relating to my late client and the fund are in my possession.\r\nHence, you do not need to worry yourself or entertain any fear in you at\r\nall in this transaction. With your consent, I will file your name\r\nofficially as the inheritor and will monitor the process, giving you every\r\ninformation/advice on how to claim this fund and successfully transfer it\r\nto your nominated bank account. You will get 50% of the amount at the\r\nconclusion of this transaction for your partnership.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I will need you to confirm your information below so that it will\r\nenable me officially file your name at the bank as the inheritor for the\r\nbank to start the release process:\r\n\r\n1. Full names\r\n2. Full address\r\n3. Occupation\r\n4. Direct telephone number for easy communication.\r\n\r\nAll I require from you is your maximum cooperation.\r\n\nHere is my Direct num +855-87496177\r\nMy whats-pp Phone Num +855.98502242\r\nHere Attached is my ID card.\r\n\r\nMr Anvanith Gui\r\nBoard member\r\nForeign Trade Bank of Cambodia\r\nPhnom Penh"

It's not every day that one receives news of such an unexpected inheritance.\n\nIt's truly tragic to hear about the fate of your late client and his family. The tsunami disaster in Sumatra Indonesia was indeed a devastating event, and it's heartbreaking to know that so many lives were lost.\n\nYou mentioned that my name is the same as your late client's. That's quite a coincidence! I'm curious, what was his name? And how did he come to be in Cambodia?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that you found my contact information from a reputable business directory. May I ask which directory this was? I don't recall listing my details on any business directories recently.\n\nRegarding the inheritance process, could you please provide more details? How does it work exactly? And what would be expected of me throughout this process?\n\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRalph"
