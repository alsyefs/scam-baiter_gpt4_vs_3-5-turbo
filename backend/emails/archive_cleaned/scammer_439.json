How did it come to be in my name? And why has it been waiting for so long?\n\nI would also like to know more about the release process. What steps are involved and how long does it usually take?\n\nAs for the bank details, I'm afraid I can't provide them at this moment. Is there any other way we could proceed with this?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nNicholas"
