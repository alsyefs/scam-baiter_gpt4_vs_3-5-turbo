How\ncould you keep trusting people and at the end you will lose your hard\nearned money, or are you being deceived by their big names? They\nimpersonate on many offices, claiming to be Governors,\nDirectors/Chairmen of one Office or the other.\nTheir game plan is only just to extort your hard earned money. Now,\nthe question is how long will you continue to be deceived? Sometimes,\nthey will issue you fake check, fake ATM card, introduce you to fake\ndiplomatic delivery,UN-existing on-line banking and they will also\nfake wire transfer of Your fund with Payment Stop Order.\nAnyway ,by the virtue of my position, I have been following this\ntransaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing the\nfund. More often than not, I sit down and laugh at your ignorance and\nthat of those who claim they are assisting you, it is very unfortunate\nthat at the end you lose.\nAlthough, I don't blame you because you are not here in person to\nwitness the processing of your payment . The problem here is\nthat you've never been told the whole truth about this transaction and\nit is because of this truth they decided to extort you.\nThe most annoying part is even fraudsters have really taken advantage\nof this opportunity to enrich themselves at your expense, those you\nfeel are assisting or working for you are your main problems.\nI know the truth surrounding this payment and i am the only person who\nwill deliver you from this long suffering if you will abide by my\nadvice. Please i beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being\ndeceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this mail so\nthat I can explain to you the mods-operand i guiding the release of\nyour Payment. Do not panic or have fear for anything know you have\ngone through hell but time has come to reap.\nFurthermore, all i need from you is trust, just give me the trust all\nyour information is here with me, because i have worked in UN office for\nover 18 years both in Africa and UK and there is no means of receiving\npayment that cost anything except court affidavit of claim if the\nowner is not there in person, which can only cost you $100.00 only.\nIn addition, all the fees they ask both transfer cost or delivering\ncost, clearance certificate non of them exist. If you really want\nus to proceed send me your direct contact or you ignore my letter if\nyou are not interested.\nMr John M. Little\nDirect Phone number +1 202 556 3081    "
