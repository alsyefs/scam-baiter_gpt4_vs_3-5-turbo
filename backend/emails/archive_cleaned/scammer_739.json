        "body": "My name is Emily Portney, CEO of BNY Mellon's Asset Servicing. I was very\r\nclose friends with the late American citizen engineer Richard D. Petrelli.\r\nOn July 7, 2013, he died in an automobile accident that took place right\r\nhere in New York. On July 20, 2014, an oil consultant for American\r\nPetroleum Corporation made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for\r\nUS$155,000,000 for a period of twelve calendar months. (In US dollars, one\r\nhundred and fifty-five million) After these many futile attempts, I made\r\nthe decision to hunt and find his relatives online, but to no success. I\r\nfound your email in a business guestbook, and I have a strong intuition\r\nthat you are a trustworthy individual. I can rely on you to complete this\r\ndeal without raising the American Government's concerns about the sizable\r\nsum of money that Late Engineer Richard D. Petrelli fought hard for and\r\ndeservedly owned. (He was a good man who, unaware that he would soon die,\r\nthought he could build the largest chemical firm in the United States right\r\nhere in New York.)\r\n\r\nI reached out to you so that we might work together to repatriate the\r\ndeceased's funds, which were held in an account at my bank with a balance\r\nof about US$155,000,000, before they were seized or declared in this\r\nlocation. (In US dollars, one hundred and fifty-five million) As a result,\r\nI received a notification from the bank advising me to provide the next of\r\nkin or else his account might be frozen. I need your permission to name you\r\nas the deceased's last remaining next of kin (you don't have to share the\r\nsame last name with him to do this), so that the account's\r\nUS$155,000,000.00 value can be paid to you and we can split it equally,\r\nwith 50% going to you and 50% for me, since I have been unable to contact\r\nthe relatives for more than a year. With your participation and assistance,\r\nwe will get the legal records necessary to establish the claim that is in\r\nyour favor. You only need to participate sincerely and honestly if you want\r\nto help me with my business. I guarantee that this will be done in\r\naccordance with a written agreement that will protect you from any legal\r\ninfringements. Please provide the information requested below so that we\r\ncan continue our conversation. I appreciate your consideration of my advice.\r\nFull name:\r\nAddress:\r\nPhone:\r\nOccupation:\r\n\r\nThanks for your kind cooperation\nRegards\r\nEmily Portney"

It's always sad when someone passes away unexpectedly.\n\nI must say, your proposal is quite intriguing and it's not every day that one gets an opportunity like this.

        "body": "This is to formally acknowledge receipt of your email and the content\r\ntherein. To be completely honest with you, I have been looking for the\r\ndeceased relatives for the past six years, but to no avail. The government\r\nhas already given me some months to find or notify the next of kin of the\r\ndeceased's funds; if I fail to do so, the funds will be confiscated and\r\nclaimed by the government. I do not want his laboriously earned money to be\r\ntransferred to the government's holding account. Since there is no next of\r\nkin listed on the account where the money is located, it makes it difficult\r\nfor me to allow the government to claim his hard-earned money. He was a\r\ngood friend of mine when he was alive and is an honorable man whom any\r\nright-thinking person will look up to with trust and dignity.\r\n\r\nWhen he was alive, he always had the best interests of Americans in mind\r\nand would always support initiatives that would benefit all American\r\npeople. Because of this, I prefer that we spend the remaining money to aid\r\nthe underprivileged Americans rather than letting the government take it.\r\nI'm the CEO of BNY Mellon's Asset Servicing, as I mentioned in my earlier\r\nemail, and with your help and cooperation, along with my position within\r\nthe bank, I'll be able to obtain the crucial legal records that may be used\r\nto support the claim in your favor. To make this arrangement happen, all I\r\nneed is your real and sincere collaboration. I promise that this will be\r\ncarried out in accordance with legal agreements that will safeguard you\r\nfrom any legal violations.\r\n\r\nI can guarantee you that this is not a con, and we will split any fees\r\nnecessary to complete this transaction equally (you pay half while I pay\r\nthe other half). I guarantee you with my life that you won't regret helping\r\nus do this. Please see my ID below, along with a few more documents that\r\nwill be delivered to you for review when you agree to do this transaction\r\nwith me. Print the Memorandum of Understanding, fill it out, and email it\r\nback to me so that we may go on to the next stage of this transaction. To\r\nenable us to continue our conversation, kindly enter the details provided\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nFull Name,\r\nAddress,\r\nPhone,\r\nOccupation.\r\nI appreciate your thoughtful assistance.\nRegards\r\nCEO of Asset Servicing\r\nEmily Portney"
