        "body": "  From The Desk of:\nMr.  Charles Westmoreland ,\nAuditor General, Natwest Bank Group,\nCaryle House, Carlyle Rd, Cambridge,CB4 3DH,\nUnited Kingdom.\nDear Friend,\nI am Mr. Charles Westmoreland, Auditor General of Natwest Bank Group, UK. In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of £16.400.000.00 (Sixteen Million, Four Hundred thousand British Pounds Sterling) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers, Late Mr. Robert Thorgrimson an American who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31, 2000, including his wife.\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin or relatives to come over and lay claims to his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Unfortunately, I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the knowledge of this funds behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and two other officials in this department now decided to make business with you and release the money to your possession as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement, since nobody is laying claims to it and we don’t want this money to go back into Government treasury as unclaimed bill.\nThe banking law and guidelines here stipulate that such money remaining after seven(7) years will be transferred into the banking treasury as unclaimed funds. We agreed that 35% of this money would be for you as gratification for assistance rendered, while the balance will be for my colleagues and me. I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets into your account. Please be honest to me as trust stands to be our watchword in this transaction. Our assurance is that your role is risk free to accord this transaction the legality it deserves as with all modalities put in place we are certain in actualizing a hitch free transfer of the funds without any complications. Kindly signify your intention to assist by sending me an email for further procedures relating to this transaction.\nPlease note that all necessary arrangements for the smooth release of these funds to you have been finalized. We will discuss much in detail when I receive your response. If you are interested in this project,please contact me as a matter of urgency on my private mailbox (\ncwestmoreland242@gmail.com\n) for further directives.\nBest regards,\nMr. Charles Westmoreland.

        "body": "Hello Mr. Charles,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with such an interesting proposition. I must say, it's not every day that one receives an email about a large sum of unclaimed money.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the tragic fate of Mr. Robert and his daughter. It's always sad when lives are lost in such unfortunate circumstances.\n\nYou mentioned that you and your colleagues have decided to release the money into my possession as the next of kin or beneficiary of the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement. Could you please elaborate on how this process would work? \n\nAlso, I'm curious about why you chose me for this task? There must be many people who could potentially fill this role.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nVicenta"
