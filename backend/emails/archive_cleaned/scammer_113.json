I don't recall transferring any money to a Thailand bank account. Could you please provide more details about this? \n\nAlso, could you explain how my name ended up in that account? I'm quite puzzled by this situation.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBetty"
