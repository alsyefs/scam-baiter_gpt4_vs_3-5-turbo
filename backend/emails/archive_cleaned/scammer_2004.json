        "body": "  Dear sir ,\n With Regards to Your previous statement,\nListen very ,very well because I want you to get the points and the message the officials are trying to transmit to you.\nThe message here is that , there has been an arrangement to pay foreign beneficiaries like you and the arrangement is that ,there is an appointed chief sponsor who can be regarded as an investor, hence it means that there is an agreement which makes the investor to takes care of all charges both your flying ticket to the payment center and your Hotel accommodation charges including feeding etc until you are paid and when you are paid then the this chief sponsor is entitled to 5% and immediately you are paid of this $10.5 Million USD. The chief sponsor (investor) will also get his 5% .\nIN VIEW OF THIS FACT,the investor is not doing this for free of charge rather he will get 5% of your payment when you are paid.\nThis arrangement  is made  easy for beneficiaries who intend to travel with ease and also without spending a dime or cent before receiving their due outstanding approved FUND of $usd 10,500,000,00 Million part payment only.\nIn furtherance,I am the SUPERVISOR of OVERSEA DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE UK.\nYou will agree with me that you will not stay more than a few days for this endorsement of the documents.\nUpon the receipt of your international passport I will furnish you the area and location you will be flying to .\nThe earlier we receive your positive response towards this trip , the better the officials will quickly book your flight ticket and  hotel reservations.\nIt makes no sense if you did not get or understand what we are really talking about ? So send your direct whatsapp phone number for  easy communication from there on, I shall inform you the location/destination of your journey/trip as other beneficiaries have gone to this payment  center to endorse these vital documents and they are back happier in as much as once you are paid you settle the investors without any issue.\nYours sincerely,\nMS SAMIRA  ASMA\nGEORGE DANIEL\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR  \nOVERSEA DEBT  RECONCILIATION\nCOMMITTEE UNITED KINGDOM   "

        "body": "Hello MS SAMIRA ASMA and GEORGE DANIEL,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I must say, it's quite an interesting proposition you've presented. If I understand correctly, there is a chief sponsor investor who will cover all my expenses until I receive my approved fund of USD Million part payment. After which, the investor will get a percentage of my payment.\n\nI'm curious about this arrangement. Could you please provide more information about the investor? How was he chosen and what guarantees are in place to ensure that he will fulfill his obligations?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what documents need to be endorsed at the payment center? And how long does this process usually take?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about other people who have gone through this process? It would be reassuring to hear about their experiences.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
