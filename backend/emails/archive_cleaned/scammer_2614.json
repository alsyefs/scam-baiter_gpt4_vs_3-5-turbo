        "body": "Hello MRS Joy FRANCIS,\n\nThank you for your email. I'm quite intrigued by this opportunity, although I must admit, it's a bit confusing to me. Could you please clarify a few things?\n\nFirstly, could you explain why my name isn't currently listed as the receiver of the payment? Also, how does purchasing a gift card help in this process? \n\nSecondly, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by \"the transfer will be retrieved back\". Does that mean the money will go back to its original source or somewhere else?\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about these daily payments? How much would each payment be and how long would they continue?\n\nI appreciate your patience with my questions. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLester"
