Your payment file was brought to my desk and I am surprised that\r\nyou are still struggling to receive your long awaited payment after all you\r\nhave passed through.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am very sure that you have lost hope of ever getting your fund\r\nsuccessfully transferred or released to your account after all the\r\nfrustrations, endless disappointments and broken promises in the hands of\r\ncertain officials in the past.\r\n\r\nAfter all the checks and balances, I discovered that the reason you have\r\nnot received your long awaited fund was because the officials you were\r\ndealing with refused to tell you the truth of the matter. Instead they used\r\nit as an opportunity to extort money from you in order to enrich themselves.\r\n\r\nKindly get back to me so that I can state categorically what you need to do\r\nin order to receive the above mentioned compensation fund that has been\r\nawarded to you.\r\n\r\nKindly contact me with your full name, address and telephone at my private\r\nemail below for a more elaborate explanation.\r\n\r\nEmail: usafrsve.jerome@gmail.com\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nJerome Powell\r\nChair of the Federal Reserve.\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The contents of this email message and any\r\nattachments are intended solely for the addressee(s) and may contain\r\nconfidential and/or privileged information and may be legally protected\r\nfrom disclosure."
