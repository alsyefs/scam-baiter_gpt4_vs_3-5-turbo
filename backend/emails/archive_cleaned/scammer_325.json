        "body": "Hello David Blackford,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my payment. I appreciate the update and the offer of a New Year bonus. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the payment that is in your custody? How did it end up there?\n\n2. What are the different options available for receiving the funds? Could you explain how the online transfer and ATM card options work?\n\n3. You mentioned a fee that needs to be paid in order to receive the funds. Can you clarify what this fee is for and why it is necessary?\n\n4. I'm not familiar with steam wallet as a method of payment. Could you please explain how it works and why it is accepted by your bank?\n\n5. Once the fee is paid, how long will it take for me to access my funds? Will there be any additional steps or requirements?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
