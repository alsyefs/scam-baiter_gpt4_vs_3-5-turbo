I must say, it's quite a surprise! \n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please explain more about how my email address was selected for this award? Also, could you provide some more details about the process of transferring the funds into my nominated bank account?\n\nRegarding the activation fee, is there any other way to pay it apart from purchasing a Steam wallet card or gift card? I'm not very familiar with these types of cards.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarilyn"
