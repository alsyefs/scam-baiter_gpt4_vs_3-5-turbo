        "body": "Hello Dr. Sam Williams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and wishing me a Happy New Year. I hope you're doing well too. I must admit, your message has caught my attention.\n\nI apologize if it seemed like I abandoned my box worth US Million. It's just that I haven't received any updates or information regarding it, so I wasn't sure what to do next. Can you please provide me with more details about the box and why it has been in your custody?\n\nYou mentioned a fee that needs to be paid for the United Nation Deliver Permit. Could you please explain what this fee is for and how much it would cost? I want to make sure I have all the necessary information before proceeding.\n\nAlso, could you clarify who exactly instructed you to release the packages to the United Nations once the fee is paid? Is there any way I can verify this information?\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRichard"
