        "body": "Hello Mr. Ban Kelly,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope you are doing well. I received your message regarding the final divert funds, but I must admit that I am a bit confused about the details.\n\nCould you please provide me with more information about the funds and why they need to be diverted? Also, who is this person MR JOE BEN and how are they involved in this matter?\n\nAdditionally, I would appreciate it if you could clarify what you mean by using the funds to buy an Ebay card or steam card or card. How does that relate to the situation at hand?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you with more information. Thank you.\n\nBest wishes,\nCassie"
