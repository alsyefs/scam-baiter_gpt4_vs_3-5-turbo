Firstly, I will like to introduce myself formally as  Dr. Olayemi Michael Cardoso, The Executive Governor of The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) I am re sending you this very mail once again just because the impostors are still contacting me on your behalf stating that you sent him.\nI am officially contacting you once again today because your total Funds were Re-deposited into the \"Federal Suspense  Account\" of CBN last week, because you did not forward your Claim as the Right\nbeneficiary. The Central Bank of Nigeria is the mother Bank of all commercial Banks here in Nigeria. Really coming of the strange man were unexpected by me because such visit was impromptu as i was told that he comes to collect the Inheritance Bill Sum of 27 Million United States Dollars ($27,000,000.00), which rightfully belongs to you, on your behalf.\nAt this development I asked  who authorized you to come down to Nigeria for the Collection of this Payment and was told  that you asked him to come and collect this Funds on your Behalf. In fact this\nwas the biggest shock that this Bank has ever received so far because your Inheritance Funds are still in the \"Federal Suspense Account\" of CBN, yet you sent so one  to come and collect these Funds on your behalf without notifying us.\nWe in this Bank do not understand why you sent such a person to come and Collect your Funds on your behalf. If actually you want anyone  to help you collect your approved  Bill Sum, at least you should have informed me as the Executive Governor of this Bank. Honestly, it really baffles me that you took such a decision without my consent.\nAs the Governor of this Noble Bank, I was supposed to Release these Funds to him but I refused to do so because I wanted to hear from you first. Due to the Nature of my job, I will not want to make any\nmistake in releasing this Fund to anyone except you who is the recognized  Beneficiary to this Fund.\nKindly clarify us on this issue before we make this Payment to the foreigner who came on your behalf in receipt of this confidential Letter, you are required to respond immediately to this email:\n(\ncentralbenkcustom02@gmail.com\n) with your full name, address and phone number for reconfirmation and immediate action or you call me with my mobile telephone number below for more clarification.\nBest Regards\nDr. Olayemi Michael Cardoso\nEmail: \ncentralbenkcustom02@gmail.com\nExecutive Governor Central Bank Nigeria\nFor Inquiries Call +234-9074300283   "

I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that someone is claiming to represent me without my knowledge or consent.\n\nI'm curious, could you possibly provide more details about this individual? What did they look like? Did they provide any identification or proof of their claim?\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about these funds you mentioned. How did they end up in the Federal Suspense Account of CBN? And why are they linked to my name?\n\nI appreciate your diligence in handling this matter and look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
