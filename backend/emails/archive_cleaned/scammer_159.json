        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for your email. It's quite exciting to hear about this opportunity. I'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, how did the United Nations come to select me for this fund? I don't recall having any direct dealings with them.\n\nSecondly, could you explain more about how the ATM card works? Is it like a regular debit card that I can use at any ATM machine?\n\nLastly, regarding the courier services, are these charges one-time fees or will there be additional costs in the future?\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nGregory"
