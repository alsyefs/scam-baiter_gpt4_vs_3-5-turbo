        "body": "Mr. Donald,\r\n\r\nThank you for your email and all contents well noted. There is an urgent\r\nneed for me to reach out to you. As the new Governor of CBN,  i am very\r\neager to set a good record and to release  all the pending transactions\r\nwithheld ed by Mr. Godwin Emefiele ( Former  Governor of CBN).\r\n\r\nThis transaction is 100% genuine because your name was among the names of\r\npayment beneficiaries listed by the debt reconciliation team , the record\r\nshows that you have an inheritance payment of $2.8m in CBN ( TWO MILLION\r\nEIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS), but it was agreed by all\r\nstakeholders including the United Nations, that only $1.5M will be release\r\nby Central Bank of Nigeria as first phase payment to all the beneficiaries\r\nof funds in CBN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, to process the release of this contract/Inheritance funds, I have\r\ndecided  in my capacity as the new Executive Governor of CBN, that all the\r\n payment beneficiaries will NOT pay for any processing charges till their\r\nfirst phase payment is transferred successfully  to their designated Bank\r\naccounts ,so that every beneficiary will know that this transaction is\r\nindeed Genuine and 100% legit.\r\n\r\n However, before the second phase payment will be released, the beneficiary\r\nwill send all the fees required for legal and processing charges.\r\n\r\nAll these terms and conditions will be binded by a legal team assigned by\r\nthe United Nations, to monitor the transaction in CBN.  The legal teams are\r\nmade up  of 5 man panel from different  zonal law chambers . They are well\r\nreputable attorneys.\r\n\r\nThe NOTARY comprises of all processing legal documents, with different\r\ncharges.Now to temporarily waive this documents, the legal teams will\r\nprepare an agreement letter between you and CBN, to allow you receive your\r\npart payment withoit paying changes and eventually pay all required charges\r\nafter confirmation of fund transfer from CBN , only then their outstanding\r\nbalance will be paid.\r\n\r\nHowever, the  legal team will Surely demand for a NOTARY Fee of $150 before\r\nthey will prepare an agreement letter between you and CBN.\r\n\r\nA copy of this agreement will be sent to you. The agreement letter will\r\nstand against CBN, If by any means, CBN Fails to transfer your $1.5m into\r\nyour account as agreed and also stand against  you if you fail to pay all\r\nrequired fees after confirmation of the $1.5M from CBN. Any bridge of the\r\ncontract will face court verdict. In order words, the agreement gives you\r\npower of attorney to proceed to any law court within and outside Nigeria\r\n\r\nPNOTE: Payments have been paid to many  beneficiaries and this is your own\r\nturn to receive yours.\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm enclosing my official work ID . Kndly reconfirm these details\r\nfor the processing of your payment.\r\n\r\n\r\n1..Your full names........\r\n\r\n2--Your address,....\r\n\r\n3--Occupation........\r\n\r\n4..Direct cell phone...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK DETAILS FOR FUND TRANSFER\r\n\r\n\r\n5..Bank name.....\r\n\r\n6..Bank address...\r\n\r\n7..Account no.....\r\n\r\n8..Swift code...\r\n\r\n\r\n9..Account name...\r\n\r\nExpecting your reply soon.\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nMr,Olayemi Micheal Cardoso\r\nEXECUTIVE GOVERNOR\r\nCENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA, CBN\r\nPHONE 234 8029234136"

I must say, it's not every day that one receives such an offer.\n\nI'm curious about the process involved in this.

Their role seems very important in this process.\n\nFurthermore, I'd like to know more about this NOTARY fee.

The\r\ntotal value of your payment is $2.8M . Only $1.5m will be released by CBN\r\nas first phase,after you have receive fhe funds, you will be required to\r\npay all oustanding charges which you were suppose to have paid upfront. I\r\nemplore this idea because by the time you hsve receive your part payment\r\ninto your account, you're going to feel very free to pay every charges\r\nrequired to process the transfer of your balance payment of $1.3m.\r\n\r\nI hope i have been fair enough to answer your questions in brief. If you\r\nstil refuse to submit the required details, it means you're not actually\r\nready to complete your transaction.\r\n\r\nPlease confirm your personal and account details to enable us process your\r\npaynent\r\n\r\nFull name and address, direct cell # and bank details .\r\n\r\nThanks for your understanding.\r\n\nMr. Olayemi Cardoso\r\nCBN Governor"

I appreciate the time and effort you've put into clarifying things for me. \n\nI'm still a bit confused about how my name appeared on the payment list, but as you said, it's not really our concern at this point. I understand that the NOTARY fee is going to secure an agreement between myself and CBN, which makes sense.\n\nYou mentioned that once I receive part of the funds, I'll be required to pay all outstanding charges. Could you please elaborate more on what these charges might include? Also, could you provide a rough estimate of how much these charges might total?\n\nAs for submitting personal details, I'm afraid I can't do that at this moment due to privacy concerns.
