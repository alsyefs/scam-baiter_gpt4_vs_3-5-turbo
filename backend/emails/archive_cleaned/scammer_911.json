        "body": "Dear Lina M. Khan,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information regarding the outcome of your meeting with Western Union and the Better Business Bureau. It is concerning to hear about the scams that have taken place using their services.\n\nI understand that Western Union has admitted to these crimes and has agreed to return millions of dollars to the victims. That is a significant step towards rectifying the situation. I appreciate you sharing the article confirming the legitimacy of my fund from Western Union Money Transfer.\n\nBefore I proceed, I would like to ask a few questions for clarification. How exactly did Western Union allow criminals to use their global money transfer service? Were there any specific security measures in place that were overlooked? Additionally, what steps are being taken by the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies involved to prevent such scams in the future?\n\nRegarding the allocation and dispatch of funds, could you please provide more details on how this process will be carried out? Specifically, if I choose bank-to-bank wire transfer, what information would be required from me? And what are the associated fees or charges for each method of conveyance?\n\nThank you once again for providing this information. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nCynthia"
