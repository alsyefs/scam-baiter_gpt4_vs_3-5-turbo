        "body": "Dear Rev. Richard Nnaji,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your concern and willingness to help. It's unfortunate to hear about the greed and fraudulent activities of some individuals.\n\nI understand that you have personally kept my ATM card and covering documents in a secure place. Could you please provide me with more details about the token delivery and insurance fee? How can I make the payment? Is there a specific deadline for sending the fee?\n\nAlso, could you clarify how long it would take for the package to be delivered to my address once the fee is paid? I want to ensure that I am available to receive it.\n\nThank you again for your assistance, and I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nIva"
