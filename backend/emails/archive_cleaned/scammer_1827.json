        "body": "Hello Mrs Stell John,\n\nThank you for your message. I appreciate your help and concern regarding the ATM card. It's really kind of you to have paid the delivery charges on my behalf.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please explain why the ATM card would expire in three days? Also, could you provide more details about this UPS DELIVERY SERVICE? How reliable are they?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
