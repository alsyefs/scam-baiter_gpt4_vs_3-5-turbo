However, I have a few questions before I can provide any personal information.\n\n1. Can you please explain why my ID card or passport is required for the delivery? Is it a standard procedure?\n\n2. Are there any alternative methods of verification that can be used instead of sharing my personal identification documents?\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaila"
