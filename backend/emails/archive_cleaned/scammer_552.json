        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate you keeping me informed about my funds. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the Western Union and Federal Ministry of Finance meeting? What was discussed and why is it relevant to my funds?\n\n2. Could you clarify what the \"ount\" amount is that I need to pay? Is it a specific dollar amount or is there a typo in your message?\n\n3. Can you explain why the payment is necessary in order to release my funds? What fees are involved and how are they calculated?\n\n4. Is there any way to verify the legitimacy of this request? Are there any official documents or references that can be provided?\n\nI look forward to your response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnnette"
