I appreciate your understanding of my current financial situation and your willingness to work with what I can afford at the moment.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some details in your message. Could you please clarify what MTCN stands for? Also, could you explain how the activation process works?\n\nI'm also curious about the use of gift cards like Steam Wallet Card for payment. How does this process work exactly? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSandra"
