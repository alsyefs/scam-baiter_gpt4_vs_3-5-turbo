I appreciate your trust in me and your noble intention of setting up an orphanage charity.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about the process you mentioned. Could you please explain it a bit more? How exactly does this work? And why do you need my personal details?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMargaret"
