I'm glad to know that actions are being taken against these individuals.\n\nI'm curious, how did you manage to track down these scam artists? It must have been a challenging task given the vastness of the regions mentioned. Also, could you please elaborate on how the selection process for the lucky recipients of this donation was conducted?\n\nAs much as I appreciate your offer, I would like to understand more about this process before proceeding further. Could you also provide more details about this certified bank ATM transfer? How does it work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLisa"
