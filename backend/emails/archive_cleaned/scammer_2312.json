        "body": "Hello Mr. John Martins,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear about this ACCRUED INTEREST FUND PAYMENT VALUED US. I wasn't aware of any overdue contract funds in my name.\n\nAs for the woman who came to your office claiming to be my representative, I'm afraid there might be some misunderstanding. I haven't authorized anyone to claim any funds on my behalf.\n\nI'm curious though, how did these funds come into existence? And why are they being held in different banks across Africa and other parts of the world? \n\nAlso, could you please explain a bit more about the methods of bank transfer that you mentioned - ATM CARD, ONLINE BANK PAYMENT or BANK TO BANK payment?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
