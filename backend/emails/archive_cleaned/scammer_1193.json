        "body": "Hello L. Philip,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I'm excited about the prospect of receiving my ATM Visa Card! It's great to know that it's ready and just waiting for delivery.\n\nI see there are several courier options available, which is fantastic. Could you please provide me with more information about each one? For instance, how long would delivery take with each company? Are there any additional services included in the fee, like insurance or tracking?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"the assembly in accordance with section of the national gambling acts adopted this in and ended is to protect and to avoid of funds\"? I'm not quite sure I understand this part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJessica"
