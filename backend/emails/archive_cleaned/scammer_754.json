I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it's not every day that one receives an email from the European Union head office. \n\nI'm curious about this fund you mentioned. Could you please provide more details? How was my name included in this list of scam victims? And what exactly does it mean to be a \"loyal Claimant\"?\n\nAlso, could you clarify the process of receiving the fund? You mentioned something about a Certified Bank Visa ATM card - how does that work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
