I urge you not to give up and try your best because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.\n \nFor any task you find lay before you, you have to think of the very best options to accomplish it.

Opportunity is a give and take situation, you do not fold your arms when it comes knocking, you must open your hands to receive it.\n \nPlease do everything humanly possible to get the funds needed for the surcharge even if it means for you to get a loan do it as you will pay back even if it is at 100% interest, once the funds credits to your account.\n \nKnow this: Winners never quit and quitters never win, I have to assure you that this transaction is worth taking any sacrifice for because it is a life transforming opportunity.
