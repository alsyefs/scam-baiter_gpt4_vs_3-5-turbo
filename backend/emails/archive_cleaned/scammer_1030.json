        "body": "Hello there,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I can't believe I'm receiving such an important message from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It's really exciting to hear about this award. \n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned two methods of payment - by check or ATM card. Could you please explain more about how these work? And what does it mean that the ATM card needs to be renewed in years?\n\nAlso, I'm not very familiar with Gift Card, Steam Wallet Card Gift Card or Bitcoins Wallet. Could you help me understand how these work and why they are needed for this process?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about the Code of Conduct you mentioned? What does \"In God We\" mean?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nYvonne"
