        "body": "Hello Mrs. Olivia Robert,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about the funds with the IRS. It's quite a surprise to hear that there are funds stipulated in my name, especially from Africa! \n\nI'm curious, how did these funds end up under my name? And why were they recovered from Africa? I don't recall having any financial dealings in Africa.\n\nYou mentioned that I am among a few listed to receive a sum of million United States Dollars. That sounds like an enormous amount! How was this list created and why was I included?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that I have to pay for the release order of the fund and choose between bank to bank transfer and box delivery. Could you please explain more about these options? What would be the process for each option?\n\nLastly, you asked for some personal details including Full Name, Address, Age, Occupation, Direct Telephone Numbers and Copy of my ID. While I understand your need for this information, due to privacy concerns I prefer not to share such sensitive information over email.\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about this intriguing situation!\n\nBest wishes,\nLeah"
