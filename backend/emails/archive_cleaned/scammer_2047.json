I was the personal attorney to\nlate Engr. Greg a national of your country who was a Contractor and\nChief Executive officer of {Asian development Oil Company} For 25\nyears. He has spent most of his life in (Australia & Malaysia). In\nJanuary 2020,  Engr. Greg fell sick and died due to the Corona-virus\npandemic.\nSince then I have made several inquiries in the  Embassy to locate any\nof my client's extended relatives but all efforts were unsuccessful.\nAfter these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you\nand solicit your assistance as a foreigner to execute the claim of his\nEstate Which includes cash deposits.\nI have contacted you to assist in repatriating the assets and Capital\nvalued at US$ 36.5 million left behind by my client before they get\nconfiscated or declared unserviceable by the STD bank where these huge\ndeposits were lodged. The said bank has issued me a notice to provide\nthe next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next month.\nSince I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives. I seek the\nconsent to present you as the Next of kin to the deceased, so that the\nproceeds of this account can be paid to you. The request of a\nforeigner as the next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the\nfact that my client was a foreigner and the money cannot be paid into\na local bank here, so it will be better for you to stand as the next\nof kin to my client. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response,\nwe shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer. I\nhave all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you\nup for claim.\nAll I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us to see\nthis transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under\na legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the\nlaw.\nPlease reply via e-mail to indicate your interest.\nBest Regards,\nBarr.  POWELL ANDREW\npa6803079@gmail.com\n "

        "body": "Hello Barr. Powell Andrew,\n\nI must say, your message has certainly piqued my interest! It's not every day that one receives such an intriguing proposition. I'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate demise of Engr. Greg, it sounds like he was a very successful individual.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? For instance, how did you come across my contact information and why do you believe I would be a suitable candidate for this role as the next of kin?\n\nAlso, could you elaborate on these legal documents that are needed to back me up for claim? What kind of documents are they and what is their purpose?\n\nLastly, could you explain more about the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer? How would this process work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRichard"
