        "body": "Hello Dr. Tanko Mohammed,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message has piqued my interest. It's quite surprising to learn about this abandoned payment file. Could you please provide more details about it? \n\nFor instance, how did my name get associated with this file? And why has it been left unclaimed for so many years? Also, could you elaborate on the terms and conditions that you mentioned?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
