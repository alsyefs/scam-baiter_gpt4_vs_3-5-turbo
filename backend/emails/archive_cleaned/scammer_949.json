However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the package? What is it exactly and where is it coming from? Also, why do I need to purchase a card or steam wallet in order to receive it? I'm just trying to understand the process better.\n\nBest wishes,\nForrest"
