I am the Group General Manager, Finance & Accounts of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I have a deal here in my office which I want to share with you, I need a foreign partner to execute this business with me. Me and my colleague over invoiced a contract payment valued at Fifty Million US Dollars (US$50,000,000.00). We awarded contracts for the supply and maintenance of all the oil pipelines and oil drilling equipments for the nation's oil wells to some foreign contractors.\nThe entire contract is valued at Ten Billion US Dollars (US$10, 000,000,000.00) which we over invoiced to US$50 Million addition to the total contract sum. As a matter of fact, most of the contractors have been paid and the remaining contractorâ€™s payments are under process to be paid to them. With that, me and my colleague have decided to include you among these remaining contractors to process the sum of US$50 Million in your name or your company to claim this money for our mutual benefits.\nSo 1 am now contacting you to present you as the sub-contractor who executed one of the contracts and owner of this amount of US$50 Million to be paid for the supply of heavy oil drilling equipments used in recent overhauling of the refineries.\n I will advise you to furnish me with your personal information including your personal cell phone number and the name of your company with address to enable me register it with our corporate affairs commission in charge of allied and companies registration as an indigenous company/Contractor. It is mandatory that any foreign company must be registered in this country. Also with your acceptance to execute this business with me, I need to be sure of your confidentiality towards the conclusion of this deal.\nYou will be given 30% of the total amount, while me and my colleague will take 70% once the money gets into your company or your personal account in your country. \nAlso with my position and connections here, I can officially arrange with you to be lifting 2 or 4 Million barrels of Crude Oil per month by getting a year or two years crude Oil allocation contract in your name or your company name whether you are here or not. With this we can make more money from the oil lifting here in Nigeria. I will detail you more on this once I get your response.\nThank you and hope to hear from you as soon as possible.

However, I would like to gather more information before proceeding further. Could you please provide me with some additional details about the contract and the specific oil drilling equipment that was supplied? Also, how did you come across my contact information?\n\nFurthermore, I would appreciate it if you could explain the process of registering my company with the corporate affairs commission in your country. Is there any cost involved in this registration? And what are the legal implications for a foreign company operating in Nigeria?\n\nRegarding the allocation of crude oil contracts, could you elaborate on how that works?

Are there any risks or challenges associated with this business venture?\n\nI look forward to your response and gaining a better understanding of this opportunity.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
