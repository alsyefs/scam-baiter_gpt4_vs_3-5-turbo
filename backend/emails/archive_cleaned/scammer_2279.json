During the post-election\ncivil and political crisis in our country, my parents were killed by\nheartless military personnel who supported the current president, who\nis losing the election and refusing to resign.\nFortunately for me, I attended school in Ghana when this tragedy\nhappened to my family. But I thank Almighty God because I never knew I\ncould go through the turmoil of losing my family almost. Now I'm still\nhere in the country, but for me it's very \"insecure\". I live in great\nfear and bondage. I plan to leave this country as soon as possible,\nbut the only thing that deterred me. My late father deposited (Two\nmillionTwo hundred thousand Dollars). one of the largest financial\ninstitutions.\nMy Dear, I want you to act as my trustee or business partner so that\nthe fund can be released to you on\nrequest and I can move to your country and we both have money invested\nin a good profitable venture and  I promise to give 20% of the fund.\nAwaiting a positive response.\nRespectfully\nMiss Salimata Yaya.
