Kennedy International airport, New York- working hand in hand\nwith the Department of Homeland Security and U.S Customs and Border Protection.\nDuring our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a\nDiplomat from London, UK and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of\nmoney in a metal trunk box weighing approximately 25kg each. The\nconsignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by\nthe consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid\ndiversion by the shipping agent and also the Diplomat inability to pay for\nNon Inspection Fees.\nOn my assumption, each of the boxes will contain about $3Million to\n$4Million each and the consignment is still left in the storage house till\ntoday. The consignment are two metal boxes with weight of about 25kg each\n(Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 110 LBS.).\nApproximately, the details of the consignment including your name and\naddress, and the official document from the United Nation office in London are\ntagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.\nPROVIDE YOUR NAME:\nFULL HOME ADDRESS:\nPHONE NUMBER:\nIDENTITY CARD\n:\nTO CROSS CHECK IF IT CORRESPONDS WITH THE NAME AND ADDRESS ON THE\nCONSIGNMENT INCLUDING THE NAME OF NEAREST AIRPORT AROUND YOUR\nCITY AND OTHER DETAILS.\nYou can send the required details to me by email for onward delivery. All\ncommunication must be held extremely confidential. I can get everything\nconcluded within 5-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address\nfor delivery if you assure me of sharing the content 30% for me / 70% for\nyou on my arrival to your house.\nI want us to transact this business with you and share the money, since the\nshipper has abandoned it and disappeared. I will pay for the Non inspection\nfee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this airport to your\naddress by myself. But I will share it 30%/70% with you.

It's not every day that one hears about abandoned shipments at the airport, especially ones containing such a large sum of money.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name and address end up on these metal trunk boxes? And why was the shipment abandoned in the first place? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this Non Inspection Fee? How much is it and why does it need to be paid?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAaron"

It's quite an interesting situation you've described, and I must admit, it's a bit overwhelming to take in all at once. \n\nI'm curious about the trunk boxes you mentioned. How did my name and address get tagged on them? And why was the diplomat unable to pay for the inspection fee? \n\nYou also mentioned a percentage sharing of funds. Could you please elaborate more on this? What exactly is the total amount of these funds?\n\nAs for my personal details, I hope you understand that I need to be cautious about sharing such information online. However, I can tell you that my nearest airport is John F. Kennedy International Airport.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAaron"
