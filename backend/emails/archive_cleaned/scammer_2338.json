WILLIAM R BALABIN with the new account details as follows:\nNAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION\n280 FOLLIN LANE SE VIENNA VA  22180\nACCOUNT NUMBER : 7096486183\nSWIFT CODE NFCUUS33XXX  \nROUTING  256074974\nACCOUNT NAME : MR. WILLIAM R BALABIN\nACCOUNT NAME HOLDER :820 FOLLIN IN SE  VIENNA VA,22180\nThis account information which was submitted by MR. WILLIAM R BALABIN  did not come with VALID POWER OF ATTORNEY, it is this issue that compelled me to contact you so as to receive confirmation from you on the change of account.\n \nIf this change of account was authorized by you, it has to be written in company letter headed paper stamped and signed by you; Reconfirming to me the following. 1. That the application for the change of beneficiary was done with your consent.\n2. That the said fund should be transferred into the above account. This has to be done immediately because we will not entertain any enquiry  from your so called agent who came to this office demanding your contract payment by cashier cheque, telegraphic transfer or certified bank draft: If in the alternative you did not permit any body to effect such a change of account, authenticate your disapproval to this office in your letter headed paper with all the contract and account details clearly stated.\n \nThis is to enable us avoid errors in  transferring of this fund. JP MORGAN CHASE BANK will not be held responsible for any wrong information given to us.

        "body": "Hello Mr. Daniel Pinto,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding this matter. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear about this change of account by a certain Mr. William Balabin. I don't recall authorizing any such changes.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did Mr. Balabin come into the picture and why does he have access to my contract fund? Also, could you clarify what you mean by \"VALID POWER OF ATTORNEY\"?\n\nI'm afraid I don't understand the process of writing in company letter headed paper stamped and signed by me. Could you guide me through that?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDaniel"
