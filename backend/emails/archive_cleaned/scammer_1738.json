        "body": "Hello NANA,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have provided regarding the box containing USD Twelve Million United State Dollars. It's quite an astonishing amount!\n\nI must admit, though, that I am a bit confused about the situation. Could you please clarify why the box is still at the warehouse and what needs to be done in order for it to be released? You mentioned something about signed documents and customs clearance.\n\nAdditionally, I'm curious to know more about how my address won a lottery sponsored by Coca Cola Company. That sounds like quite an exciting opportunity! Can you provide more details about this lottery and how I was selected as a winner?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nYolanda"
