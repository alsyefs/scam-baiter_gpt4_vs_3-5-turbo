        "body": "Hello Diplomat John Paul,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm thrilled to hear about the parcel and your efforts to deliver it to me. However, I have a few questions before we proceed.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the contents of this ATM CARD? What is its purpose and how did it come into my possession?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned several methods of payment for the delivery fee. Could you explain why there's a need for me to pay for the delivery? Isn't it usually covered by the sender?\n\nLastly, could you clarify what you mean by \"Any Nearest Airport\"? Are you suggesting that I pick up the parcel from an airport?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSharlene"
