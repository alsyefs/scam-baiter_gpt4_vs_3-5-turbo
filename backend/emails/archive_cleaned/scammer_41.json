        "body": "Hello there! Thank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your assistance in delivering my ATM funds. However, before I provide you with the requested information, could you please clarify a few things for me? \n\n1. Could you tell me more about The Silver Gold Bank? I would like to know more about your organization and how you operate.\n\n2. How did you come across my contact information? It's always good to understand how these connections are made.\n\n3. Is there any specific reason why my age is required? I'm just curious as to why it's necessary for the delivery process.\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of these details, I will be happy to proceed with providing the information you need. Thank you!\n\nBest wishes,\nAnthony"
