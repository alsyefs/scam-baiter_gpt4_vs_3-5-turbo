I'm really looking forward to receiving it.\n\nI understand that there are some fees associated with mailing and insurance coverage. Could you please provide more details about these costs? How much exactly do I need to pay? And could you explain why these specific cards are preferred for payment?\n\nAs for the information you asked me to confirm, I'm sorry but I can't share personal details online due to privacy concerns. Is there another way we can proceed without sharing this information?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nSteven"
