        "body": "Hello Bruce Stewart,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your response. However, I must admit that I am a bit confused about the situation you mentioned regarding Anastasia and her money. Can you please provide me with more details about this? How did she come to choose me specifically to receive her money and help her leave Ukraine? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"look for any Identity to email to me\"? What kind of identity are you referring to?\n\nI want to make sure I understand the procedures correctly before proceeding further. Thank you for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nKenneth"
