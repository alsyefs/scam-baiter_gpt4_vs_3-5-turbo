However, I have a few questions before we proceed.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the trial? What is it specifically about? Also, what kind of delivery are you referring to? I want to make sure I fully understand the situation before moving forward.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what you mean by \"the new government board of directors have issued policy for immediate delivery\"? Is there a specific reason why this policy has been implemented?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you soon with the requested information.\n\nBest wishes,\nEdith"
