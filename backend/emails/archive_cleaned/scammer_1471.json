        "body": "My name is Mr.   Donna Mchenney. I am the new  Chief Inspection Agent- at JFK International Airport and working hand in hand with the Department of Homeland Security and U.S Customs and Border Protection. During our\nInvestigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from London, UK and when opened it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box weighing approximately 25kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as\nmoney rather it was declared as a personal effect to avoid diversion by the shipping agent and also the Diplomat's inability to pay for Non-Inspection Fees of US$6467. On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain\nabout 3Million to 4Million each, and the consignment is still left in the storage house today.  \n The consignments are two metal boxes with a weight of about 25kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 110 LBS.)Approximately. The details of the consignment\nincluding your name, and the official document from the United Nations office in London were attached to the Metal Trunk boxes.  I have decided to attach to this mail a picture of the consignments captured during my inspection so that you can testify that what I am telling you is true. and genuine  All I need to do is obtain the required documents to release the consignments since your consignments are no longer under my authority and I no longer have access to them\nYou can send the required details to me by email for onward delivery. All communication must be held extremely confidential. I can get everything concluded within 5-6 hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery if you assure me of sharing the content 30% for me / 70% with you on my arrival at your house.  I want us to transact this business with you and share the money since the shipper has abandoned it and disappeared. I will pay for the Non-inspection fee and arrange for the\nboxes to be moved out of this airport to your address by myself. But I will share it 30%: 70% with you. Do you agree? \nYours sincerely,\nDonna Mchenney"
