It's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit curious about this process. Could you please explain more about how this works? How did my name come up for this ATM card? And what exactly does the card entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJulia"
