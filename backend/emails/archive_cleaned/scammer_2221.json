        "body": "Hello Mr. Chris George,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding this matter. I must admit, I am a bit confused about the situation. I have never heard of Mr. Timmy Cross or Florida Group LTD before. Could you please provide me with more information about why he is claiming to receive a payment on my behalf? \n\nAlso, I would like to know how Mr. Timmy Cross got my contact information and why he did not provide any power of attorney to prove his authorization to act on my behalf. It seems quite unusual.\n\nFurthermore, could you clarify what Deed of Assessment he is referring to and why it would make him the bonafide recipient of the funds?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in resolving this issue and look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
