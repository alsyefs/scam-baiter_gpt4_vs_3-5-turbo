        "body": "I am Mr. David Morris, Head Officer-in-Charge, and Administrative Service Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia.\nDuring our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from the United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 110kg each.\nThe consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as a personal Effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.\nBy my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 110kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective Capacity: 680 L) Approximately.\n The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from the United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your Full name, Phone Number, full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents. \nIt is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us to repatriate it back to the UK (place of origin) as we were instructed.\nLike I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s) etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back this package provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). \nYou can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of your choice.\n I need the entire guarantee that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project.\nBest Regards,\nMr. David Morris\nHead Officer-in-Charge\nAdministrative Service Inspection Unit"

        "body": "Hello Mr. David Morris,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It sounds quite intriguing. I would like to know more about the abandoned shipment and how I can potentially assist in resolving this situation. Could you please provide me with some additional details?\n\n1. How did the United Nations Inspection Agency come across this abandoned shipment? Was it a routine inspection or was there a specific reason for inspecting it?\n2. What steps have been taken so far to locate the rightful owner of the shipment? Have any attempts been made to contact them?\n3. You mentioned that the contents of the shipment were declared as personal effects classified documents instead of money. Is there a reason why the consignee chose to misdeclare it?\n4. Are there any legal implications or risks involved in claiming ownership of this abandoned shipment?\n5. Could you clarify what you meant by needing a guarantee from me before getting involved in this project? What kind of guarantee are you looking for?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in providing these details so that I can better understand the situation and determine how I can be of help.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
