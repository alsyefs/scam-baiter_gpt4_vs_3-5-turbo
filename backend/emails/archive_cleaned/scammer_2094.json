        "body": "Hello there,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I appreciate your email and the information provided about the fund transfer. It's quite a surprise to hear about such a large sum of money.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some details. Could you please clarify why there is an activation fee for the payment? Also, could you explain more about what happens if I don't manage to pay the full amount?\n\nYou mentioned that time is of essence here. Why is there such urgency? \n\nLastly, you mentioned something about getting an iTunes card or Steam card. How does this relate to the bank transfer?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJewell"
