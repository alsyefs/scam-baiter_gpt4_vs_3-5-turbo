        "body": "Dear Richard Neville Green,\n\nThank you for your detailed response. I appreciate the time you've taken to explain the terms and conditions of your loan offerings. It's quite a comprehensive list, and I must say, it sounds very appealing.\n\nI'm still in the process of determining the exact amount I would need, but I can tell you that it would be used for expanding my small business. As for repayment terms, something flexible would be ideal as business can sometimes be unpredictable.\n\nCould you please elaborate more on the Principal Payment Option (PPO)? How does deferral of principal repayments work in case of an eligible natural disaster event? Also, could you provide more information about the physical meeting requirement? Is there any specific location or can it be arranged according to mutual convenience?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRachel"
