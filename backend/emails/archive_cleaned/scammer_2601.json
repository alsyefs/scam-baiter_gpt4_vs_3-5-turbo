        "body": "Hello Mr. Micheal Cardoso,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about the new government installation in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). It's quite interesting to hear about these changes and your role as the current sitting Governor.\n\nI'm intrigued by your method of operation that was agreed upon and approved during your meetings with President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the Head of AND, and United Nations leaders. Could you share more details about this method? How does it differ from previous methods?\n\nRegarding the contract payment, I appreciate your assurance about the NOTARY CHARGE. However, could you provide more clarity on what this charge covers? Also, how is it determined?\n\nYou mentioned a legal team that prepares an agreement letter. Could you tell me more about this team? Who are they and what is their experience in handling such matters?\n\nLastly, I would like to know more about the process after paying the NOTARY FEE. What are the next steps? How long does it usually take for funds to be released and transferred?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDonald"
