I work as a senior active officer in control at one of the most reliable and trusted couriers in the United States of America.\nI am contacting you about your consignment box in transit to your location by an unidentified diplomat who couldn't complete the customs protocol. He couldn't provide the needful requirement to the U.S Customs and Law Enforcement. Luckily, I was at the airport to represent our company for large packages arriving for clearance. In the process, I accidentally encountered the diplomat. We both introduced ourselves as the senior officer in my company in charge of all items, baggage consignment boxes, other delivery belongings, etc. The unidentified diplomat contracted me to complete the formality with the U.S Customs and Law Enforcement for safety to avoid swindling and get the consignment box deposited in our safe storage warehouse. Ever since I have not heard any news or if someone applied to release the consignment box.\nMy primary purpose for reaching out to you. I have been instructed by our company C.E.O. to search metal consignment boxes to make sure I reach out to the unidentified diplomat or any of his relatives in the process, I even invite a private investigator to search for the diplomat or any of his relatives, but I was unlucky, and for my safety and the company's safety, I decided to conduct an X-ray scan to know the actual content, but to my surprise, the report revealed an undisclosed sum of money approximately $13.9 Million United state Dollars. But the consignee did not properly declare the Contents of the metal consignment box as “MONEY” rather it was declared as a personal effect to avoid interrogation from the U.S Customs and Law Enforcement.  I have been trying to reach out to the diplomat for months. Luckily,\n I found your email address on a label attached to the metal consignment box. I sent an email to the email address to know if it is valid, and it went\n; I hope you get this m\ne\nssage in good faith.\nFurthermore, As the Senior officer assigned to search for the diplomat or the diplomat relative of the metal consignment box. I want both of us to transact this as a deal 70% for you and 30% for me. All I want is your trust as the arrangement for the box to be delivered to you safely, which can be concluded within 2-3 or 4 to 5 working days after confirmation is made and upon your acceptance and willingness to cooperate. And I promise you that you won't regret doing this transaction with me because it is\n 100% risk-free and free from any branch of law\n.\nI await your swift response to enable me to furnish more information to you for the way forward.\nThank you, And remain blessed.\nBest Regards\nMr. Kenneth Ridings\nkennethridings320@gmail.com"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Kenneth Ridings,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and sharing this information. I must say, it's quite an unusual situation! I'm not sure how my email ended up on a label attached to a metal box, but here we are.\n\nI'm curious about the diplomat who was supposed to deliver the box. What happened to him? And why couldn't he complete the customs protocol?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about what you mean by \"transact this as deal\"? I'm not quite sure I understand what you're asking of me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nMargaret"
