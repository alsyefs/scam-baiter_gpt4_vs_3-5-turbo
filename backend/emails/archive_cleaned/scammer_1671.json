        "body": "Hello Ms. Kristlina Georgieva,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about all of this. I'm not sure how my name ended up on your payment schedule list, but I can assure you that I am very much alive.\n\nI have never met or heard of Ms. Donna K. Heberling before and certainly did not give her any power of attorney over my affairs. It's quite alarming to hear that someone is trying to claim funds in my name.\n\nCould you please provide more details about these funds? How did they come to be associated with my name? And what exactly does the IMF do?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about these codes you mentioned? What are they for and how should I use them?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nGary"
