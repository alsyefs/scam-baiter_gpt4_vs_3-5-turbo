I'm sure many customers will appreciate this initiative from Bank of Erica.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about the Razer Gold Card or Apple Card? How do they work in relation to the transfer charges?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about how the funds transfer process will take place? I'm not quite clear on that part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nDoris"
