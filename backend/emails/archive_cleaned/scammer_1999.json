Because of the frauds going on in African countries where some innocent beneficiaries were asked to pay in advance before receiving their money owed to them.\nThe Africa union leaders held a meeting with the United Nation here in Washington, D.C USA and resolved to pay all beneficiaries in cash through means of diplomatic courier service. We receive your files from the international Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) as one of the beneficiaries.\nTake note: that the amount to be received to you through diplomatic means is ($2,500,000.00) Two Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars.\nIf anybody tells you that he is paying you in bank draft or telegraphic money transfer both western union and money gram, do not listen to him or her because due to this frauds no international bank honors our remittance instruction any more that is why we settled to pay in cash or by ATM Card through courier means.\nAs a senior banker, controlling the cash payments, I advise you not to waste your money by paying anybody in advance again except any instruction we give to you, and if you just follow my instruction, you will receive your funds in cash within 72 hours. Your fund will now be packaged in a consignment box and take to the courier delivery company for their diplomat delivery agent to proceed on the shipment, I will also send the details of the consignment box together with the picture by attachment to you to see how the money is packaged, and I will give you more information for you to know the genuineness of this transaction.\nTherefore, do send your receiving home address and direct phone number. More details  will be sent to you regarding this development.\nMind you that the only required fee you will be asked to pay is the delivery fee of your consignment box, which can not be deducted from your mean fund, and it has to be paid to the courier delivery service before their delivery agent will proceed on the delivery to you.\nAm waiting to hear from you with the required information in receipt of this mail.\nDr. Alfred George Leonard\nDirector Cash Processing Unit\nM&T Bank United State"

        "body": "Hello Dr. Alfred George Leonard,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing! It's not every day that one receives an email from a senior banker of the Bank United State.\n\nI'm curious about this whole process. Could you please explain more about how this cash payment system works? And why has the United Nation chosen to handle payments in this way?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the courier delivery service? How secure is it? I would like to know more about their reputation and reliability.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
