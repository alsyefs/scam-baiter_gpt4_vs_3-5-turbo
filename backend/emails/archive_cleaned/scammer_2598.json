        "body": "Hello Mr. Peter F. Stanton,\n\nThank you for your detailed message and the information about my supposed funds. It's quite a surprise to hear about this, as I don't recall having any contract with the government or expecting such a large sum of money.\n\nCould you please provide more details on how this situation came to be? How did my name get associated with these funds? And could you explain more about this Transfer Permit TPC? I'm not familiar with it.\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the fees mentioned in your message. Why are they necessary and what exactly do they cover?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
