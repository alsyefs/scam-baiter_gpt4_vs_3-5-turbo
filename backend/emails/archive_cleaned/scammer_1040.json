        "body": "Hello Jonathan Taylor,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your efforts in transferring the funds to my bank account. However, I have a few questions before we proceed.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the approval process? How was my fund approved for transfer?\n\n2. Could you explain what a TELEX TRANSFER is and how it differs from other forms of fund transfers?\n\n3. I noticed that you mentioned an attached approval and copy of the transfer slip. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any attachments in your message. Could you please resend them?\n\n4. You mentioned that I need to notify you once the fund reflects in my bank account. Is there a specific method or contact person I should reach out to for this notification?\n\n5. Lastly, could you clarify what urgent matter you are referring to? Is there anything specific that needs my immediate attention?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nVincent"
