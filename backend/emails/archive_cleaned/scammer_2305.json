I'm just a simple person, so it's nice to know there are people out there looking out for me.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about what this loan is for? And how will it help cover all required fees till my funds are paid?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the Federal Bureau team department? What exactly do they do and how will they be helping me?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nTherese"
