        "body": "Hello Mr. William Johnson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing! It's not every day that one hears about an unclaimed ATM card with such a substantial amount of money.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in relation to this ATM card? And why would the ATM CARD center want to divert it to the Government Treasury? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this service fee? What exactly does it cover?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nHeather"
