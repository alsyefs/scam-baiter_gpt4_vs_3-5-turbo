It's quite exciting to hear that there is an ATM card worth a million dollars waiting for me! I appreciate the efforts of DHL EXPRESS Courier company in handling this matter.\n\nI understand that the delivery fee has already been taken care of, which is very generous. However, I'm a bit confused about the insurance coverage fee. Could you please explain why this fee is necessary and how it protects my package?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details on how to make this payment? You mentioned using Money Gram or purchasing a Steam Wallet Card or Gift Card. Could you guide me through this process?\n\nLastly, I would like to know more about the tracking number. How will it be issued and how can I use it to track my package?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"
