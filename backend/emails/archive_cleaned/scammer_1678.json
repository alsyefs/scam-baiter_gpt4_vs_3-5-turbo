        "body": "Hello Mr. Benard Robert,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite intrigued by your message, although I must admit, it's a bit confusing. Could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, could you explain what this \"Release Permit\" is? I've never heard of such a thing before and would like to understand its purpose.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that there is a control number available in my name. Could you tell me more about this control number and how it relates to the transfer?\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about the payment method? You mentioned sending through card or steam wallet card - how does this work exactly?\n\nI appreciate your patience in explaining these matters to me.\n\nBest wishes,\nEdward"
