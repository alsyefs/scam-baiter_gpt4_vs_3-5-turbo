        "body": "Hello Ms. Harpreet Mann,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have shared regarding the transfer of funds from the World Health organization. It's interesting to hear about the damages caused by inflation and pandemics.\n\nI understand that I need to pay an activation fee in order to receive the funds through Western Union. Could you please provide me with more details about this fee? How can I make the payment? Is there a deadline for paying the fee?\n\nAdditionally, could you explain what MTC numbers are and how they are related to receiving the funds? I would like to understand the process better before proceeding.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nJared"
