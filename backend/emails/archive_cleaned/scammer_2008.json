        "body": "Dear Morris,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the clearance of my funds. I appreciate the efforts of the United Nations and the Federal Bureau of FBI in ensuring that individuals like myself receive what is rightfully ours.\n\nI would like to know more about the two methods of payment you mentioned, namely Bank Cashier Cheque and Atm Card. Could you please provide me with some additional information on how each method works? This will help me make an informed decision on which option would be most suitable for me.\n\nAlso, I noticed that you mentioned a money-back guarantee if I do not receive the payment package within a certain timeframe. Can you please elaborate on this guarantee? How does it work, and what steps would need to be taken in case such a situation arises?\n\nThank you once again for your assistance. I look forward to receiving your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDorothy"
