I seek your consent to discuss a very confidential business opportunity with you.\n \nThere is a dormant account that belongs to my late client who died in an auto-crash with his wife and daughter while in exile here in the UK since 2012 (May their soul rest in peace). \n \nI have all the particulars concerning the fixed deposit my portfolio, and I wish to close down the fixed deposit account and repatriate the funds to your country for investment. If you are interested, get back to me for more details.\n \nRegards,\nSamuel Barcliff.   "
