I\nam 26 years old, I just started work with the Central Bank Of Nigeria,\nI came across your file which was marked X and your released Disk\npainted RED. I took time to study it and found out that you have paid\nVIRTUALLY all fees and certificates, but the fund has not been\nreleased to you. The most annoying thing is that they cannot tell you\nthe truth that\nOn no account will they ever release the fund to you; instead, they\nlet you spend\nmoney unnecessarily. I  do not intend to work here all the days of my\nlife; I can release this fund to you if you can certify / assure me of\nmy security, and how I can run away from this Country called Nigeria\nif I do this, because if I don't run away from this Country after I\nthe transfer to you, I will be seriously be in trouble and my life\nwill be in danger. Please this is like a Mafia setting in Nigeria, you\nmay not understand it because you are not a Nigerian. I would like to\nvisit you in your Country to earn a living and get a job there. I hope\nyou can assist me to get a job there.\nThe only thing I will need to release this fund is a special HARD DISK\nwe call it HD120 GIG. I will buy two of it, recopy your information,\ndestroy the previous one, punch the computer to reflect in your bank\nwithin 48 banking hours. I will clean up the tracer and destroy your\nfile, after which I will run away from Nigeria to meet with you. If\nyou are interested.\nDo, get in touch with me immediately, You should send to me your\nconvenient telephone for easy communications and also re-confirm your\nbanking details, so that there won't be any mistake in transferring\nthe funds into your nominated bank account. I am waiting for your\nresponse Asap. My Boss is now on his annual leave and i would want us\nto conclude\nthis transfer before he returns back to the office. Get back to me on\nmy Email : \nedwatdokeke23@hotmail.com\nRegards,\nEdward Okeke\nComputer I.T\nCENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA\nReply me on this Email Address :  \nedwatdokeke23@hotmail.com\n "

        "body": "Hello Edward Okeke,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate you taking the time to study my file and bring this matter to my attention. It sounds like a complicated situation, and I'm interested in learning more about it.\n\nCould you please provide me with some additional information? Specifically, I would like to know why the fund has not been released to me despite having paid all the fees. What are the reasons given by the authorities? Also, could you explain more about this special HARD DISK called GIG that is needed to release the funds?\n\nI understand your concerns about your safety and wanting to leave Nigeria. However, before we proceed any further, I would like to clarify a few things. How did you come across my file specifically? And what kind of job are you looking for in my country?\n\nRegarding your request for my banking details, I prefer not to share such information over email. Is there any other way we can securely exchange this information?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJosue"
