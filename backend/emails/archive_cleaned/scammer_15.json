        "body": "Hello Mr. John C. Williams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite a surprise to hear about the fund in my name, I must say! \n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up for this award? And why is it that the fund has been held by the Federal Reserve Board New York USA and the Secretary General of the United Nations United State?\n\nAs for receiving the payment, I think I would prefer the ATM Card method. It sounds more convenient for me. But could you please explain a bit more about how this ATM VISA CARD works? How can I use it to withdraw money and transfer funds to my local bank account?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about stopping contact with every other person. Could you clarify what you mean by that? \n\nLastly, regarding the USPS fee of Dollars, could you provide more details on how I should make this payment? You mentioned something about Steam wallet card Itunes card OR Apple gift card - are these the only methods available?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJean"
