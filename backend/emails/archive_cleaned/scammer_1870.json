        "body": "Dear Mr. James Obiora,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding this matter. I must admit, I am a bit confused about the details you have provided. Could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, who is Mr. John and how did he submit something on my behalf? I don't recall authorizing anyone to do so. Can you provide more information about his relationship to me and why he would be contacting your bank?\n\nSecondly, what exactly is the purpose of this fund? You mentioned a payment value of US dollars, but I'm not sure what it is for. Could you please explain further?\n\nLastly, I want to ensure that everything is done legally and properly. You mentioned the need for a power of attorney from me. Can you explain why that is necessary and what it entails?\n\nI appreciate your prompt response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nElijah"
