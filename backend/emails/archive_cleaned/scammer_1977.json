        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. It's quite a lot to take in, but I'm trying my best to understand it all. \n\nSo, if I got this right, there's a sum of USD Nine Hundred And Fifty Thousand United States Dollars that has been instructed to be paid to me? That's an enormous amount! But why was my fund transfer stopped or withheld at the Ecowas office?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that I will be receiving this payment bit by bit every seven hours. Could you please explain more about how this process works? \n\nAnd lastly, you mentioned something about an IMF sign and stamp fee. How much is this fee exactly? And why is it required by the IMF?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions. As I said earlier, I'm just trying to understand everything clearly.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
