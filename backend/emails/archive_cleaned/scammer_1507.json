        "body": "Hello Ms. Allison Madueke,\n\nI hope you're doing well. I'm sorry to hear about your situation and the challenges you're facing. It must be really tough for you right now.\n\nRegarding the expenses for the lawyer, I understand that it's necessary to cover the required documents for the release of funds. However, I have a few questions before I can consider helping out.\n\n1. Can you provide more details about why the government has seized your assets? What led to this situation?\n2. How much is the fee required by the lawyer? Is there any flexibility in that amount?\n3. Could you explain how exactly the lawyer will secure the legal documents and represent me at the bank? What are their qualifications and experience?\n\nI appreciate your understanding and patience in answering these questions. It's important for me to have a clear understanding of the situation before making any decisions.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCraig"
