        "body": "Dear Beloved,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm sorry to hear about your health condition and the difficult situation you are facing. It must be challenging for you to be going through this alone without any family members or children.\n\nI understand that you have a significant amount of money in Burkina Faso, both with the St Andrews Missionary Home and at the BANK OF AFRICA BOA. It's kind of you to consider donating the funds to orphanages in my country.\n\nI would like to help if I can, but I have a few questions first. Could you please provide more details about how exactly I can assist you? What specific steps do I need to take in order to access and distribute the funds? Additionally, is there any legal documentation or process that needs to be followed?\n\nI appreciate your trust in me and hope that we can work together towards fulfilling your wishes. Please let me know how we can proceed.\n\nWishing you strength during this difficult time.\n\nBest wishes,\nJoseph"
