However, I do have a few questions that I'd like to clarify before we proceed further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the nature of these projects? What kind of projects are usually funded under this program?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned low interest rates and flexible payback periods. Could you elaborate on these terms? How is the interest rate determined and what flexibility is offered in terms of repayment?\n\nLastly, could you explain the process involved in applying for this funding? What kind of documentation or information would be required from my end?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLisa"
