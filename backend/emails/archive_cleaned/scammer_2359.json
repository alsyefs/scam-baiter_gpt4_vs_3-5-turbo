Can you please provide more details about this situation? I want to make sure I understand the procedures that need to be followed in order to receive the funds.\n\nCould you let me know how much money is involved and what steps I need to take? Additionally, it would be helpful if you could explain why these funds were left for me and how EFG bank London is involved.\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you with more information.\n\nBest wishes,\nSue"
