        "body": "Good day Nicholas Dimos,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have provided regarding the ATM Card valued at Eight Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. It's concerning to hear about internet scams and I'm glad that the FBI is taking action to address this issue.\n\nI understand that there is a delivery insurance charge of dollars required in order to receive the ATM Card. Could you please provide more details on how this insurance works? What does it cover exactly? I want to make sure that my money and the ATM Card are fully protected during the delivery process.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify which mailing company will be handling the delivery of the ATM Card? It would be helpful to know their name and any tracking information they can provide.\n\nLastly, I would like to confirm if there are any other fees or charges associated with receiving the ATM Card apart from the delivery insurance charge. I want to ensure that there are no surprises or hidden costs involved.\n\nThank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarmen"
