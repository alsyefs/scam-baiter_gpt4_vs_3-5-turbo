        "body": "Hello Mrs. Elizabeth York,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the United Nations Fund Program. I appreciate you providing me with this information about the HCDI Human Capital Index and Millennium GOLD, MDG. It's interesting to hear about the efforts being made by the United Nations in response to the global economic crisis and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nI understand that your department, the Pay Settlement Commission (PSC), has been authorized to handle the settlement payments for those who have been victims of scams involving Money Gram, Western Union, and other money agencies. It's good to know that steps are being taken to support individuals who have lost money due to fraudulent activities.\n\nCould you please provide more details on how this payout process works? How does one qualify for this settlement? And what are the next steps for someone like me who has been identified as a victim?\n\nBest wishes,\nTerry"
