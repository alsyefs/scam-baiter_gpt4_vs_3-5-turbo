        "body": "Hello Peter,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite surprised to hear about this unpaid delayed contract payment from the United Nations. It's a substantial amount, isn't it? Ten million! That's quite something.\n\nI must say, though, I'm a bit confused about this Mr. Julius Fletcher you mentioned. Could you tell me more about him and how he is related to my case? \n\nAs for the bank account details, I think there might be some misunderstanding here. I don't recall endorsing any new bank account or authorizing any changes recently.\n\nBefore we proceed further, could you please provide more information on this contract? What exactly does it entail and why am I receiving such a large sum?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAndre"
