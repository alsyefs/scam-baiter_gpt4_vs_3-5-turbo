        "body": "Hi dear ,\nThank you for your prompt response to my email and to better explain this, I'd like to get straight to the point. I work for a company in the United Kingdom, that produces antiviral, retro-viral injections, treatments and food supplements for export as a Research Assistant.\nA major component of our  production of these products is the  Nitrovicilin herbal Oil NC002 herbal oil. Now my company is in urgent need of this\"Nitrovicilin herbal Oil NC002\" to start production, but at this time my company does not  have any sellers available to buy it from.\nBut I was able to find a local distributor on my own who offers the highest quality of this product at a bargain price of $9,500 per drum compared to the price of$22,400 per drum that we used to buy from other suppliers.\nI intend to project someone from a different area to my company directors as the supplier, who will be a Centerman between  the local dealer that I found and my company because  I donâ€™t want my company to  know the original local dealer because of my private interest in the business.\nI would step in to introduce you to our company as a new local dealer from your country. The reason for this is because I don't want my company to have direct contact with the local agent that sells herbal oil extract very cheap.\nAs a local seller, you ship to us at a cost of $22,400 or less. This will attract the attention of our managers to buy from you. For each drum of herbal oil extract purchased, we have a chance to earn a net profit of about $12,900.\nWe typically buy 85 to 100 barrels quarterly. So do the math yourself and see how much profit you can make from this trade every 3 months. This can be another income generating business out of your speciality as you dont need any experience in the pharmaceutical field to participate with me.\nI am confident that the benefits of this business opportunity will allow us to establish ourselves as partners. I look forward to working with you.\nSincerely,\nWesley Edward"

        "body": "Hi Wesley,\n\nThank you for reaching out and explaining this business opportunity. It sounds like an interesting venture, especially since it involves the production of antiviral treatments and food, which are very important in today's world.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please explain more about the herbal oil? What is it made from? And why is it so crucial to your company's products?\n\nAlso, I'm wondering how the shipping process would work. Would I be responsible for arranging the shipping or would your company handle that?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about this.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"

        "body": "Dear Charles,\r\n\r\nFirst of all I must apologize for my late response and further inform you\r\nthat the supply of this product is open to the public and my employers have\r\nbeen receiving offers for the supply of mentioned herbal oil, but we\r\nstrictly deal with supply based on the purity level of the oil and so far\r\nnone of the prospective suppliers products have been approved due to poor\r\npurity level.\r\n\r\nI however believe we still have a chance at taking advantage of the\r\nsituation since I am 99% certain that my contacts products will match the\r\npurity level demanded by my employee.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to your questions, This herbal oil is obtained from a SCARCE\r\norganic plant that is nurtured under good environmental conditions and is\r\ngrown only in specific regions in Africa and some parts of Europe. The\r\nherbal oil is produced when the raw form of the herb is cold-pressed and\r\npressurized and the resulting product is what is known as Sedogroxin HY22.\r\n\r\nRight after the coronavirus pandemic due to reductions in demand and health\r\nconcerns my employers main and only local supplier had to permanently shut\r\ndown till date and now we have a huge order for products which this herbal\r\noil happens to be the main ingredients for it's production , like I\r\nexplained I took my time and made some serious search and was able to\r\ndiscover a local direct farmer/supplier based in Turkey who can supply us\r\nwith this product at very subsidized rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe scheme of work:\r\n\r\nThis is where you come in, You will act as a front local dealer and will\r\nsupply to our company at the rate of US$21,500.00 per barrel. This price is\r\nvery considerate as it is a lot less than what we used to purchase from our\r\nold supplier ,therefore my company purchasing officer will be more than\r\nwilling to make a quick purchase of as many drums of this herb oil as\r\npossible  because of the pressure we are facing to get back to production\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nBut in all sincerity the local supplier is selling at a cheap rate of\r\nUS$8,500 per drum, which is far cheaper than our previous purchases , I\r\nhope you now see where we shall be making our profits from ? It is a clear\r\ncase of purchasing at a low rate of $8,500.00 and selling at minus plus\r\n$21,500.00 therefore making profits of $13,000.00 on each barrel of this\r\nherbal oil and this is not inclusive of the freight cost from the supplier\r\nin Turkey to my employer's warehouse in the UK.\r\n\r\nI have done all necessary investigations into this and have also reached to\r\na contact who works with the supplier ,made enquiries and have even\r\nobtained a little sample of the herbal oil which I have carried out an\r\nanalytical test on and have confirmed that it is pure and the exact\r\nspecification needed by my company,least I forget this is a very urgent and\r\npressing matter that can start and be concluded in less than 3 weeks time\r\ntherefore your time and attention will be needed in order to achieve this.\r\n\r\nShipment of the herbal oil which comes in barrels/drums will be arranged by\r\nthe supplier on our behalf under instruction directly to my company . These\r\nbarrels will carry any name we wish to instruct the supplier to mark on the\r\nshipment document.\r\n\r\nNote that the whole idea is to conceal the name and contacts of the\r\nsupplier so my company does not find out and start dealing with them\r\ndirectly and cut us off as middlemen.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts so we can proceed further.\nBest regards,\r\nRamona Heidi"

        "body": "Dear Charles,\r\n\r\nSorry for my late response , work has really been at its peak for a while\r\nas we are into heavy demands and a lot of production is going on therefore\r\nmy attention is always needed in the factory and lab plus I am working over\r\ntime lately to earn more and meet up with some personal needs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point I think I have broken down this transaction to you enough for\r\nus to move to the business part of the deal but it seems you are not clear\r\nabout a couple of things which I will try and explain to you in the\r\nsimplest form ,also understand that I am a science guy and have very vague\r\nidea about business though I have conceived and nursed this business idea\r\nfor a while and have processed it over time and know it is doable. I have\r\nworked here for a while and have somehow managed to follow up on how the\r\ncompany goes about its procurement of materials used in production .\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only reason why I am not following this up by myself and need a partner\r\nis because my work contract forbids me for getting involved in any business\r\nthat has to do with supply of goods and services back to my employers ,\r\nthis is the sole reason why I have contacted you and in business there must\r\nbe trust as long as money is involved , this is why we must agree and put\r\npen to paper before we move into business propre and this is where the MOU\r\ncomes in , an MOU stands for Memorandum Of Understanding . This document\r\nshows an proves that as gentlemen we have agreed to pursue this endeavor\r\nand once our purpose is achieved we will split the profits as agreed and it\r\nwill also state that any information shared between us will be treated as\r\nconfidential and will not be divulged to a third party or used against each\r\nother even if we eventually disagree at a point we shall part ways amicably\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe major commitment here for you is that you will make out time to be\r\navailable to establish and exchange communication between you and my\r\ncompany's chief procurement officer , you shall also be the link between\r\nthe supplier and the buyer .Once we agree I will provide you with the\r\ncontacts of the mentioned players in this transaction .Have in mind that my\r\ncompany sees you as the supplier and not a middleman and on no occasion\r\nshall we release the contacts of the supplier to them or we shall lose\r\nrelevance and the profits from the deal.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood a thing is that my employers will be funding the procurement of the\r\nherbal oil , they shall be giving us a 60% total cost of the goods up front\r\nand the balance 40% as soon as shipping documents are provided to them .\r\nAll we need to do now is to convince them that we can supply and also prove\r\nto them that the purity level of the products is at least 95% .\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also mentioned that this might be a one time supply of a certain\r\nquantity of the herbal oil or we might end up getting a 1-3 years supply\r\ncontract of the herbal oil and this is a big deal my friend, so if you are\r\nto get involved with this then you must give it your time and attention as\r\nthe profits at the end of the day will be worth every bit of the stress it\r\nmight cost us.\r\n\r\n\r\nKindly note that this supply deal is open to the public and it's a first\r\ncome first serve basis ,therefore if eventually some other supplier happens\r\nto provide samples of this herbal oil and it meets up the required purity\r\nlevel then we have lost out on the deal. This is why we have to move fast\r\nand this can only happen after the MOU is drawn up and we sign then we can\r\nmove into business properly .\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe I have stated my plans clearly and it's best we proceed as\r\nplanned , kindly provide me with your credentials to enable the MOU to be\r\ndrawn up immediately .\nBest regards,\r\nRamona Heidi"

I'm sorry if I seem a bit slow on the uptake, but I'm just trying to make sure I understand everything correctly. \n\nFrom what I gather, you're suggesting that we enter into a business deal where we supply your company with certain materials. However, due to your work contract, you can't be directly involved in this supply chain. Is that correct?\n\nI must admit, the idea of signing an MOU (Memorandum Of Understanding) sounds very official and important! It's something I've never done before so it's quite exciting.\n\nYou mentioned that my main role would be to establish communication between your company's chief officer and the supplier. That sounds like a big responsibility! But don't worry, I'm up for the challenge.\n\nIt's also great to hear that your company will be funding the purchase of the herbal oil upfront. That certainly takes some pressure off!\n\nHowever, there are a few things that are still unclear to me. For instance, how do we ensure the purity level of the products? And what happens if another supplier beats us to it?\n\nI hope you don't mind all these questions. As you know, I'm not much of a business person so all this is new to me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
