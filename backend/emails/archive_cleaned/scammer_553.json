        "body": "Hello Sir William Pelham Barr,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it's not every day that one receives an email from the Department of Justice.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the high rate of scams and how they are affecting innocent citizens. It's a terrible thing indeed. I'm glad to hear that measures are being taken to help victims recover from such unfortunate incidents.\n\nIt's also heartening to know that my email address was among the first five people selected to receive funds as part of the COVID Economic Recovery Funds. That's quite a surprise!\n\nHowever, I have a few questions before we proceed further:\n\n1) Could you please provide more details about this fund? How was it established and what is its main purpose?\n\n2) You mentioned that the funds have been deposited with PNC Bank United States head office. Could you provide some proof or documentation regarding this?\n\n3) Regarding the payment file fee, could you explain why this fee is necessary? And why does it need to be paid via gift cards?\n\n4) Lastly, could you provide more information about Mr. William S. Demchak? What role does he play in this process?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTeressa"
