It's so generous of you to share your wealth with others. \n\nI'm curious, how did you decide to select the recipients of your donation? And what inspired you to donate such a large amount of money?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nP.S: I am not comfortable sharing my personal details over email for security reasons. Is there any other way we could proceed with this?\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
