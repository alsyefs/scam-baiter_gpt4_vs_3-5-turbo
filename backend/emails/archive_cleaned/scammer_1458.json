Furthermore due to allegations of corrupt practices\r\nagainst other Banks, the Government has appointed this Bank to effect all\r\nforeign overdue payments. By this method, a Domiciliary Online Account will\r\nbe opened for you.\r\n\r\nA domiciliary account is a secure account which we will open for you in our\r\nBank and Credit your fund for further credit into your account. The essence\r\nof this Domiciliary account is to secure and protect your payment from\r\nbeing diverted by fraudulent people or making payment to a foreign account\r\nwhich does not belong to you. The greatest advantage is that you can\r\ninstruct us to credit your nominated account bit by bit with a small amount\r\nthereby saving yourself from the trouble of the Financial Authority in your\r\ncountry who monitors large transfers due to the current trend of terrorism.\r\nAnother beauty of the domiciliary account is that you can retain the\r\nbalance left in your account in our Bank and can also instruct us to pay\r\nout money to any Bank of your choice in the world, or issue you an ATM Card\r\nwhich you can use in any part of the world when on a business trip.\r\n\r\nI hope you now understand the advantages of a Domiciliary Online account\r\nand why you need this account to receive your payment.\r\nKindly provide us with the followings info and quote your (contract Amount)\r\nexpected to be paid to you\r\n\r\n1) Your Full Names\r\n2) Your Contact address\r\n3) Your Age and occupations\r\n4) Any form of identification , ie A scan copy of your Driver's License\r\n\r\nconfirm your transaction, your fund transfer code is CBNX2018 USD FGN , The\r\nonline Account will be opened as soon as you provide the above\r\ninformations. This process will take only three working Banking days, it\r\nwill be done under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you and\r\nmyself from any breach of law and be rest assured that it will go smoothly\r\nonce you adhere to my directives and no government so ever can withhold the\r\nfund from entering your account because you have fulfilled all legal\r\nobligations required of you\nRegards\r\nLawrence Okobia"
