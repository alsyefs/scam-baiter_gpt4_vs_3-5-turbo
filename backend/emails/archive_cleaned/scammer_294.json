I do not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one problem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.   \n \n Some time ago, your Nigerian friends, I mean the people that introduced you to the project approached me through my dear husband who worked with the Federal Ministry of Finance of Nigeria before He retired, requesting me to assist them  conclude a money transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them by removing the original contractor’s name, company’s name and bank particulars  from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Finance Ministry vetting the computer and replacing them with your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the rightful beneficiary of this fund.\n \nI agreed on the condition that they will pay me US$80,000.00 as soon as your name appears as the beneficiary. I agreed and demanded to be paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you promised to send money to me. \n \nDo you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from them and have not set my eyes on any of them?   Based on their attitude, I decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my job.  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute any contract in Nigeria , although I am the only person privileged to know this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude this project. Now I am ready to forget the past.\n \nI do not need the US $80.000.00 any longer from you but a good compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them are aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money unnecessarily on CBN Officers both here and overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did the work at the beginning and only I can perform it.\nFinally, I need your promise that no official of the Central Bank of Nigeria will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my former position. Now re-assure me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my husband to establish a foreign account in your country where my compensation will be lodged.\n \nAlso a TRANSFER FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS will be sent to you for endorsement after which your will be released to your bank account within 48 hours.\nPlease re-confirm the followings,to PRESIDENT BOLA AHMED TINUBU OF NIGERIA IMMEDIATELY,THROUGH HIS BELOW CONTACT DETAILS AND RECEIVE YOUR OVERDUE OUTSTANDING PAYMENT:\n1) Your Full Name.\n2) Phone, Fax And Mobile #.\n3) Company Name, (if any) Position And Address.\n4) Your Bank account Details .\n5) Profession, Age And Marital Status.\n6) Copy Of your Int'l Passport/Driving license for proper identification.\nI am a woman of my word, if you are ready to conclude this business, kindly contact PRESIDENT BOLA AHMED TINUBU OF NIGERIA,WITH THE BELOW CONTACTS AND FORWARD YOUR DETAILS TO HIM AND IMMEDIATELY,RECEIVE YOUR OVERDUE OUTSTANDING PAYMENT OF $15.5M,USD.\n EMAIL ADDRESS:bolaahmedtinubu20003@hotmail.com\nWHATS APP TELEPHONE NO: +234 7065864763.\nReply.\nimage.png\nYours Faithfully,\nMrs.Zainab Shamsuna Ahmed,\nFORMER,Minister of Finance,Federal republic of Nigeria,\nTel No:+234 8027086027.

        "body": "Hello Shamsuna Ahmed,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your direct approach and willingness to share information. I must admit, I have been curious about the delays and issues surrounding the release of this fund. It's interesting to hear about your involvement and the request made by my Nigerian friends.\n\nI understand your concerns regarding the previous arrangement and the lack of payment you received. It's unfortunate that they did not fulfill their promise to compensate you. However, I'm glad that you are now willing to forget the past and move forward with a new approach.\n\nI assure you that I am committed to concluding this project, but I would like some clarification on a few points. Firstly, could you please explain why it is necessary for me to keep this new approach a secret from my colleagues? Secondly, what kind of compensation are you expecting in return for your assistance?\n\nOnce these details are clarified, I will be more than happy to contact President Bola Ahmed Tinubu with my information and proceed accordingly.\n\nThank you again for reaching out to me.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
