        "body": "Hello Mr. Peter Onward,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite surprising! I had no idea that my name was on a list of people yet to be paid. This is certainly news to me.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate incident involving Morgan. However, I can assure you that I am very much alive and well. It's quite strange that someone would claim otherwise.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this debt recovery process? How did my email address end up on this list? And what exactly does this unpaid fund pertain to?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nEthel"
