        "body": "My dearest friend Thomas, thanks for your quick response to my message. I\r\nam so grateful. Meanwhile, i am very sorry for getting back to you late, it\r\nwas due to my present health condition in the hospital now, as i have not\r\nbeen able to face my computer for a while.  I know how you might feel about\r\nthis message, but I want you to remember that everything is possible with\r\nthe Lord as he alone knows why he chooses you as the rightful person to\r\nhave my fund for this very orphanage project. Please i need you to do me a\r\nlittle favor, just keep this very business to yourself alone for security\r\nreasons. Please, do not disclose this to anybody around you, being your\r\nCHILDREN, FAMILY MEMBERS or even your best FRIENDS about this fund, until\r\nyou receive the money in your position, because sometimes people you trust\r\nso much can turn around to be the devil or enemy behind your success in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nI instructed my personal doctor, Donald Bouma to email you on my behalf due\r\nto my illness at the moment, because right now, I can hardly face my\r\ncomputer nor answer telephone calls. I want you to know that it is the\r\nspirit of the Lord in me that directed me to choose you as the only\r\nbeneficiary of the funds I have left in my account, for you to help the\r\npoor orphans in your home country. I also want you to believe and\r\nunderstand with all your whole heart that this is real and has nothing to\r\ndo with online scam, because I do not want anything from you in return\r\nexcept your prayers and trust.\r\n\r\nMy name is Mrs. Donna Brown; I'm an 82 years old woman. I was a merchant\r\nand owned two businesses in Dubai. I was also married without children.\r\nUpon that I found out that I have breast cancer. My Husband contracted a\r\nstrange illness, when he discovered that I have blood cancer which took his\r\nlife. And ever since I got this strange illness of mine, I strongly devoted\r\nmy life to god and I have been using my funds to support charity\r\norganizations around the world, and some individuals that the spirit of god\r\nleads me to...Please note that the total amount that I am willing to you is\r\n$12.500,000.00 USD and 60% of the money, must go to the charity\r\norganizations orphanages in your city, while the remaining 40% of the money\r\nis for you to support your own family financially, as directed by the\r\nspirit of god in me.\r\n\r\nThis is god's blessing to you and myself too, listen, before I got this\r\nstrange illness, making money and my business was all I cared about, I\r\nnever really cared about other values in life. But since the death of my\r\nlovely Husband and the arrival of this strange illness, I have found a new\r\ndesire to assist helpless families and motherless homes around the world.\r\nPresently, I am in a hospital where I have been undergoing treatment, and\r\nmy last wish is to see that the remaining $12.500,000.00 USD left in my\r\nname is willed to a god-fearing person before I die which happens to be\r\nyou. Because family, relatives and friends have taken so much of my wealth\r\nsince my illness, and I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge\r\nresponsibility to any of them again.\r\n\r\nRemember, I willed this money to you with all my heart, and I believe it is\r\nthe will of god for me to meet you in good faith. Please I want you to be\r\npraying for me because my health is getting worse every day, but keep on\r\npraying for me, I believe there is nothing lord cannot do. I have remitted\r\nthe total $12.5 Million Dollars into an ATM MASTER CARD, sealed inside an\r\nenvelope which I deposited in Colonial Express Delivery Company,  and I\r\nhave already instructed the company management to have the ENVELOPE\r\ndelivered to you as my beneficiary. Please, all I want is for you to start\r\nup a good orphanage home for the less privileged in your country\r\nimmediately you receive the ATM CARD and use it to withdraw money, as that\r\nis the only thing that will please my spirit and soul.\r\n\r\nDo get back to me immediately you receive this message, for more\r\ninformation on how to claim the ATM CARD sealed ENVELOPE in Colonial\r\nExpress Delivery company, for the orphanage charity project. More\r\nimportantly, please keep this transaction very secret to yourself alone for\r\nsecurity reasons, until you receive the ATM CARD in your disposal, because\r\nI don't want any other person to be aware of this very business except you\r\nand Colonial Express Delivery management for security reasons.\r\n\r\nI need you to send me the below information so that I will mail it to the\r\ndelivering company, for self-keeping, and proper identification of you.\r\nAttached is a copy of my photo in the hospital.\r\n\r\n\nFull Name:\r\n\r\nPhone Number:\r\n\r\nWhatsApp Number:\r\n\r\nCountry House address:\r\n\r\nAge and Occupation:\r\n\r\nCopy of your Picture OR Photo\r\n\r\nThank you and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\r\nYou are blessed.\r\nMrs. Donna Brow"
