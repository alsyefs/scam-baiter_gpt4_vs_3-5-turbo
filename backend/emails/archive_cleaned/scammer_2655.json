        "body": "Hello there! Thank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you provided about my funds being lodged into Wood Forest Bank in the USA. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. Can you please clarify why the funds are being transferred via telephone banking? Is there a specific reason for this method?\n\n2. What is the purpose of transferring the funds without involving the IMF? Could you explain more about this?\n\n3. How does this new payment method help me access global telephone banking? Are there any benefits or advantages to using this service?\n\n4. Can you provide more details about the transfer process and how long it might take to complete?\n\nI look forward to your response and thank you again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
