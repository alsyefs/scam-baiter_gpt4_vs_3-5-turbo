        "body": "Hello Mrs. Mary C. Daly,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my payment files from the banks. I appreciate your assistance in ensuring that I receive the funds owed to me. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with providing my bank account details.\n\nFirstly, could you please clarify why my payment was not released by the Bank officials? What were the flimsy excuses they provided? It's important for me to understand the reasons behind this delay.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned the option of loading and shipping a Visa Card to my address for daily withdrawals at ATMs. Could you provide more information about this option? How does it work and what are the associated fees?\n\nLastly, I noticed that you mentioned a required Fund Recovery Files Approval Fee. Can you explain why this fee is necessary and how it will help in expediting the transfer of funds into my personal bank account?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nGertrude"
