        "body": "Dear Ruth Karome,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must admit, it does come as a surprise to hear about these funds and the involvement of the Chinese Investment Company. Can you please provide me with more details about how this situation came about? How did the Chinese Investment Company become aware of these funds and why are they interested in pursuing them?\n\nAdditionally, I would appreciate it if you could share the email address of Mr. CHIN YUN HIN, the company accountant, so that I can communicate directly with him and learn more about their intentions regarding these funds.\n\nThank you again for bringing this to my attention. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDaniel"
