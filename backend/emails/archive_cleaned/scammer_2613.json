        "body": "Dear Rose Thomas,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your efforts in helping me receive my funds. However, before I proceed, I have a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the source of these funds? How did I become eligible for such a large sum of money?\n\n2. Is there any specific reason why the funds are being sent through Western Union? Are there any other options available for receiving the payment?\n\n3. Could you clarify how often and for how long I will be receiving payments through Western Union? Is there a set schedule or is it flexible?\n\n4. What security measures are in place to ensure that my funds are safe during the transfer process?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance from Director Mr. Benard William.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"
