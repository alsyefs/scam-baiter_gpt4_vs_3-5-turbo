        "body": "Hello Williams,\n\nThank you for your detailed email. It's quite exciting to hear about the ATM Visa Card and its value. I must say, it's a lot of information to take in at once.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that the card is protected with a hard cover of an insurance policy. Could you please elaborate on what this insurance policy covers? \n\nAlso, could you explain why I need to purchase an Apple Gift card or Steam wallet Gift Card? I'm not very familiar with these things.\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about the delivery process? How will I know when my card has been shipped and how can I track its progress?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nOdell"
