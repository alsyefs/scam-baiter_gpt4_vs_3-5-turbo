        "body": "  This is the final warning you will receive from me. This notice has\nbeen sent to you in many occasions/ several times but you ignored it.\nI have warned you so many times and you decided to ignore my e-mails\nbecause you believe we have not been instructed to get you arrested,\nif you fail to respond back to us with the payment details below, then\nwe would first send a letter to the MAYOR of the city where you reside\nand also direct the bank to close your account until you comply with\nour directives. Note that all your properties will be confiscated by\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation. We would also send a letter to\nthe  company/organization you work for so that they could get you\nfired until we are through with our investigations because a suspect\nis not supposed to be working for the government or any private\norganization.\nYour ID which we have in our database has been sent to all the crimes\nagencies in America for them to upload you in their website as an\ninternet fraudster and a terrorist (suicide bomber). I will also warn\npeople to stop having any dealing or friendly communication with you\nanymore. This would have been solved all this while if you have gotten\nthe CERTIFICATE ENDORSED AND STAMPED. I,Christopher Wray, Director of\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wish to inform you that\nthere is no more time left to waste because you have been given enough\ngrace, therefore you have been mandated to comply immediately you read\nthis e-mail if you don't want to be arrested. As stated earlier, to\nhave the document endorsed and stamped without any delay, you must\nadhere to this directive to avoid you from blaming yourself at last\nwhen we must have arrested and sentence you to life imprisonment. Note\nthat all your properties will be seized and bank account will be\nconfiscated too.\nHowever, I have decided to see how i can be of help to you because i\nwould not be happy to see you end up in jail and all your properties\ngot confiscated because your information was used to carry out\nfraudulent transactions. I called the EFCC Benin (Economic And\nFinancial Crimes Commission) and they directed me to a private\nattorney who can help you get the process done and he stated that he\nwill endorse and stamp the document at the sum of  $100 USD only and i\nbelieve this process is cheaper for you. You need to do everything\npossible to get this process done today or tomorrow because i have\nbeen informed by the ARREST WARRANT ISSUANCE DEPARTMENT that the\nwarrant of arrest has been prepared against you and once is being\nsigned by me as the FBI DIRECTOR, and then the arrest will be carried\nout in the next 48hours. from our investigations, we learnt that you\nwere the person that forwarded your identification to one impostor/\nfraudster in Nigeria when he had a deal with you in regards to the\ntransfer of some illegal funds into your bank account which is a\nheinous offense.\nWe have investigated and found out that you don't have any idea when\nthe fraudulent deal was conducted with your information's/identity and\nright now your ID is placed on our database as a wanted person. I\nbelieve you know that it will be a shame to you and your entire\nfamily. Also it will be announced in all the local channels that you\nare wanted by the FBI. Note: All the crimes agencies have been\ncontacted on this regard and we shall trace and arrest you if you\ndisregard this instruction. You are advised to make the payment for\nthe signing and stamping of the document today, failure to do that\nwill attract a maximum arrest and finally we shall apply for\nlitigation against you. Thereafter, you will appear in ADMINISTRATIVE\nDISTRICT COURT OF WASHINGTON D.C for terrorism, money laundering and\ndrug trafficking charges. Be warned; do not try anything funny because\nwe are monitoring you from our satellite.\nMeanwhile, I pleaded on your behalf so that this agency could give you\ntill 1PM today so that you can get this process done. Bear it in mind\nthat this is the only way that i can be able to help you at this\nmoment. But if you fail to comply you will face the law and its\nconsequences once it had befallen on you.\nYou can pay the one time required $100 usd by steam card and get back\nto me immediately today to get this matter resolve, and once you get\nthe $100 by steam card or iTunes card then send me the card copy to\nfaster everything for you to receive your compensation fund.\nDo not hesitate to make the payment today with the above outlined\ninformation so that they will have the certificate endorsed and\nstamped immediately without any further delay. After all this process\nis being carried out, then we will have to proceed to the bank for the\ntransfer of your funds valued at $10,500,000.00 only which is supposed\nto have been transferred to your bank account.\nNote: As you can see below, all the crime agencies have been\ncontacted on this regard and we shall trace and arrest you if you\ndisregard these instructions. You have been given a grace from today till tomorrow to make the payment for the document but after your failure\nto do that you will attract a maximum arrest and finally you will be\nappearing in court for act of terrorism, money laundering and drug\ntrafficking charges, so be warned not to try anything funny because\nyou are being watched.\nCC: Canadian Police Association\nCC: Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\nCC: GENERAL INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT (GID)\nCC: Asia Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG)\nCC: Egmont Group\nCC: FEDERAL BURUEA OF INVESTIGATION (FBI USA)\nCC: European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)\nCC: Financial Action Task Force (FATF)\nCC: International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nCC: International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)\nCC: International Banking Security Association (IBSA)\nCC: International Air Transport Association (IATA)\nCC: Institute de Formation Interbinary (INSIG)\nCC: World Customs Organization (WCO)\nCC: Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)\nCC: Offshore Group of Banking Supervisors (OGBS)\nCC: WORLD CENTRAL BANK (WCB)\nCC: NIGERIA POLICE FORCE (NPF)\nCC: NORTH YORKSHIRE POLICE (UK)\nCC: ECONOMIC FINANCIAL CRIME COMMISSION (EFCC)\nFBI Director Christopher Wray\nDirect phone number +1 202 443 2822\nWhatsapp number +1 202 443 2822   "

        "body": "Hello there,\n\nWow, that's quite a message you've sent me. I must admit, it's a bit overwhelming and confusing. Could you please clarify a few things for me? \n\nFirstly, what exactly is this document that needs to be endorsed and stamped? And why does it cost USD to get this done?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned something about my ID being used in some fraudulent activities. Could you provide more details about this incident? I'm not aware of any such thing happening.\n\nLastly, could you explain the process of making the payment via steam card? I'm not familiar with this method.\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeigh"
