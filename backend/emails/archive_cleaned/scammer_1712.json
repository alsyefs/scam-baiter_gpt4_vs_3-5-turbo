Additionally, it is necessary for you to personally\r\nvisit our office to sign for the release of your funds. This is because the\r\npresident has instructed us to settle all beneficiaries who have not\r\nreceived their funds through the petroleum trust fund account (PTF), which\r\ncurrently holds sufficient funds.In the event that you are unable to come\r\nto our office to handle your file personally, it would be helpful to engage\r\nthe services of a lawyer who can represent you and ensure the smooth\r\nrelease of your funds. If you do not have a lawyer in this regard, please\r\ninform us, and we will arrange for a reliable lawyer to work on your\r\nbehalf, ensuring that your documents are properly authenticated in court\r\nand facilitating the release of your funds.Once your documents are being\r\nauthenticated, you will receive your funds whichever means you wish to\r\nreceive it.I kindly request your prompt response to this matter.Yours\r\nfaithfully,Mr. Folashodun ShonubiActing Governor of the Central Bank of\r\nNigeria. *"
