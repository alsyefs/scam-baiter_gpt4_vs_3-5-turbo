I don't recall instructing anyone named Mr. Ruben Francisco Garcia from Honduras to transfer any funds on my behalf. \n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did Mr. Garcia come into possession of my information? And what exactly does this fund entail?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nIrma"
