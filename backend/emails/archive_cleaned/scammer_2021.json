        "body": "Dear Oliver Alawuba,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your concern and the information you have provided. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. Can you please explain in more detail what exactly is the financial assistance in the form of a soft loan that you are offering? How does it work and what are the terms and conditions?\n\n2. You mentioned that there are necessary Certified Clearance documents required to prove the legitimacy of the payment. Could you please clarify what these documents are and why they are needed?\n\n3. I noticed that you mentioned the option of receiving the payment through digital or crypto currencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. How does that process work, and what are the advantages of choosing this method?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
