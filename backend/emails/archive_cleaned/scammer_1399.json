I appreciate your concern and the information you've shared with me.\n\nHowever, I must clarify that I don't know any Ms. Tatyana Cole. It's quite surprising to hear about her claim of being my representative. Could you please share more details about how she got in touch with you? Did she provide any proof or documentation to support her claims?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars that she is claiming on my behalf? How did this amount come into the picture?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRoy"
