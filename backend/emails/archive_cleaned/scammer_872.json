        "body": "  Sometimes I wonder if you are really, really with yourself. How could you keep trusting people and at the end you will lose your hard-earned money, or are you being deceived by their big names? They impersonate in many offices, claiming to be Governors, Director/ Chairmen of one office or the other. \nTheir game plan is only just to extort your hard-earned money. Now, the question is how long will you continue to be deceived? Sometimes ,they will issue you a fake check, ATM CARD, introduce you to fake diplomatic delivery, UN-existing on-line banking and they will also fake wire transfer of your fund with payment stop order. \nAnyway, the virtue of my position, I have been following this transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing the fund. More often than not,  it is very unfortunate that at the end you lose. Also using someone came to their office to claim your fund or you authorized someone as your representative to draw your attention. \nAlthough, I don't blame you because you are not here to witness the processing of your payment. The problem here is that you've never been told the whole truth about this transaction and it is because of this truth they decided to extort you, then keep collecting money from you. \nThe most annoying part is even fraudsters have really taken advantage of this opportunity to enrich themselves at your expense; those you feel are assisting or working for you are your main problems. \nI know the truth surrounding this payment and I am the only person who will deliver you from this long suffering if you will abide by my advice .Please I beseech you to stop pursuing shadows and being deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this mail so that I can explain to you the modus-operandi guiding the release of your payment. Do not panic or have fear for anything, i know you have gone through hell but time has come to reap. \nFurthermore, all i need from you is trust, just give me the trust all your information is here with me, because i have work in UN office for over 8 years both in Africa and UK and there is no means of receiving payment that cost anything except Court affidavit of claim of fund certificate if the owner is not there in person, which will not cost more than $1, 750 USD. \nIn addition, all the fees they ask both transfer cost or delivering cost, clearance certificates known of them exist. If you really want us to proceed, send me your direct contact or you ignore my letter if you are not interested. \n \nI must be truthful and straightforward to you. Truth is bitter but I will always live with it since I was brought up with it. Think twice and have a change of mind so that you will achieve our aim. I will give you more details as soon as I get your response. \nSincerely, \n \nMrs. Janet Olisa   \n \n(Director Of Ministry Of Foreign Payments) MINISTRY OF FOREIGN  \nAFFAIRS, HEADQUATERS - ABUJA    "

        "body": "Hello Mrs. Janet Olisa,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and sharing your concerns about the trustworthiness of certain individuals claiming to be in positions of authority. I understand that there are many scams out there, and it can be difficult to differentiate between genuine opportunities and fraudulent schemes.\n\nI appreciate your offer to guide me through the release of my payment. Can you please provide more information about the process? How exactly would you assist me in ensuring that my funds are delivered safely? Additionally, could you clarify what you mean by \"the only person who will deliver me from this long suffering\"?\n\nI want to make sure that I fully understand the situation before making any decisions. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nBest wishes,\nGary"
