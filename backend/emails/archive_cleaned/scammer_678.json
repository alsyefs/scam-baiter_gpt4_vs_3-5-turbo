        "body": "Dear C. Bush,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the transfer of my funds. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring that I receive my payment. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with the required fees.\n\n1. Can you please provide more information about the Homeland Security Transfer Permit Fund account activation and Cost of Transfer COT? What exactly are these fees for?\n\n2. Is it possible to deduct the fees from the total amount of my funds instead of paying them separately? It would be more convenient for me if that were an option.\n\n3. Could you clarify why the fee needs to be paid using iTunes cards or through Western Union or Ria? Are there any other payment methods available?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed with this transaction.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
