It's great to hear that there has been progress with the fund release.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please provide me with more details about this process? I'm interested in understanding how it works and what steps are involved. \n\nAlso, could you clarify what exactly the \"official and fund release signal\" means? Is there any documentation or reference number related to this?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nWayne"
