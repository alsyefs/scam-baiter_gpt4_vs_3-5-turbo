I'm glad to know that there are no charges required from me for this transaction.\n\nHowever, I'm curious about a few things. Could you please explain more about how this process works? And why is it necessary to reconfirm my current delivery address and nearest airport?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohnathon"
