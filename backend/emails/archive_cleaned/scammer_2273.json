I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that a package valued at such a high amount has been abandoned. \n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did my name get associated with this package? And why was it abandoned by the delivery agent in the first place?\n\nI'm also curious about the process of registering the package with UPS or another courier service. Could you explain how that works?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nScott"
