        "body": "Hello Dr. Frank Lawal,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about the fund. It's quite a surprise to hear about this, but I must say it sounds intriguing.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in this list of individuals to receive the ATM Master Card? Also, could you please explain a bit more about how the ATM card works? Is there any specific reason why the maximum withdrawal is set at USD per day?\n\nI'm also wondering if there are any other fees or charges associated with receiving and using this card, apart from the shipping fee mentioned. \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarcy"
