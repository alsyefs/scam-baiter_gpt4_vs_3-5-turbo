        "body": "Hello Mr. Patrick Robinson,\n\nWow, that's some news! I'm so glad to hear that my case has been settled positively. It's really interesting how you've converted the fund into a Morgan ATM card. I didn't even know such a thing was possible!\n\nCould you please tell me more about how this works? How can I use this card and are there any fees associated with it? Also, is there a limit on how much I can withdraw from an ATM machine worldwide?\n\nI'm sorry but for security reasons, I can't provide my home address over email. Is there another way we could arrange for the delivery of the card?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRichard"
