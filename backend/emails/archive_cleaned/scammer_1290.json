My residential address is as follows, 605 Cotton Ave.\nCaruthersville, Missouri  63830 United States, am thinking of\nrelocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in\nthe compensation in West Africa many years ago and they refused to pay\nme, I had paid over $86,400 while trying to get my payment all to no\navail.\nSo I decided to travel to Washington D.C with all my compensation\ndocuments, And I was directed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation\nDirector to contact Mr. John Alfred, who is a representative of the\nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (IMF) and a member of the Compensation\nAward Committee, currently in Washington D.C (USA) and I contacted him\nand he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us\nthrough emails are fake.\nHe took me to the paying bank for the claim of my compensation\npayment. Right now I am the happiest woman on earth because I have\nreceived my compensation funds of $5.8 Million US Dollars. Moreover,\nMr. John Alfred showed me the full information of those that are yet\nto receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the\nbeneficiaries on the list he showed me, that is why I decided to email\nyou to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund,\nthey are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact\nMr. John Alfred. \nKindly send your personal details to him to prove\nyour identification.\nFull Name:\nHome Address:\nOccupation:\nPhone Number:\nAge:\nGender:\nCountry:\nYou have to contact him directly on this information below.\nCompensation Award Office.\nName: Mr. John Alfred\nEmail: \njohnalfred@aliyun.com\nYou really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting\nyou and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway\nwith them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you\nup until you have nothing. \nThe only money I paid after I met Mr. John\nAlfred was just $850USD for the paper works, take note of that.\nOnce again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact\nMr. John Alfred so that he can help you to deliver your fund instead\nof dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for\ndifferent kind of money to complete your transaction.\nThank you and be blessed.\nMrs. Linda Stepp\n605 Cotton Ave. Caruthersville,\nMissouri  63830.
