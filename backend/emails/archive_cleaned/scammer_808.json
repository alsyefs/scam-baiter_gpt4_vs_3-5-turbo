        "body": "Hello Mr. Neil Gorsuch,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite interesting to hear about this opportunity. However, I'm a bit confused about some details. Could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, could you explain why there is a fee involved in receiving these funds? Also, what exactly is the purpose of this fee?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned something about a tunes card or Google Play Card copy. I'm not very familiar with these terms. Could you please elaborate on what they are and how they relate to the transaction?\n\nLastly, could you provide more information about the Federal High Court and Federal Ministry of Finance's involvement in this process? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLavern"
