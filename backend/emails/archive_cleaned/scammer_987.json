Diosdado Macapagal Boulevard, Pasay City Philippines 1300. I handle all our Investor's Direct Capital Funds and secretly extract 1.2% Excess Maximum Return Capital Profit (EMRCP) per annum on each of the Investor's Capital Funds. As an expert, I have made $ 16 million from Investor's EMRCP and hereby looking for someone to trust who will stand as an Investor to receive the funds as Tenure Investment Proceeds.\nA brief history of funds: I have more than 208 Corporate Investors attached to my portfolio whose Capital Investment Funds are being managed and administered by me. This Capital Investment fund has a value of over US$ 19.2 billion net. The US$19.2B is used for trading in Stock Market, Crude Oil, and Lending with Profit Returns. At the end of the year, each corporate investor is expected to receive interest from his total Investment Capital Funds. However, I make an excess of 1.2% from the Investor's Investment Capital Funds annually which have exceeded our targeted 20% of Total Investment Capital Funds.\nThis extra  1.2% from the 21.2% is being retained by me as my personal profits for managing the Capital Investment. However, I cannot claim these funds without presenting someone to stand as an Investor otherwise our establishment will convert the funds into the company's treasury. This is why I have come to you for the deal to take place.\nThis is a fair deal without any risk attached either on your part or on my part as long as we comply with the laws governing the claiming of funds in our establishment.\nIf Interested Please Send me your full name, address, and Telephone number, so that the attorney can start putting together the necessary paperwork that would facilitate the release of the money to you.\nPlease reply via my Private Email: \ngvalencianob@outlook.com\nKind regards,\nGerry B Valenciano (Mr)"

        "body": "Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nThis is to acknowledge the receipt of your correspondence and enclosed information.  Rest assured you wouldn't be brought into odium as a reason of this transaction or your association with me.\r\n\r\n I am happy that you are willing to work with me in this transaction. I pray that you see this transaction in the light of its attendant benefit as I am simply inviting you to share and uphold the level of wealth that you might not have in a whole lifetime for a better life for our kids and yet unborn. I have decided to explain to you in detail to enable you to have 100% comfortability toward this dream of ours. We have to work fast to achieve our objective within the next 10 banking days as earlier indicated.\r\n\r\n I am so happy to work with you if you are ready to keep this transaction very confidential the code of this operation is \"Partnership protection first\", Live a low-key lifestyle, and remember, \"Loose Lips Sink Ships\". You and I have the capability to accomplish this project and you must see this as a sensitive project for which I will be spending so much money and making so many commitments. I therefore insist on strict confidentiality and believe that you can be trusted with the same. The need for confidentiality in all matters relating to this transaction is of great importance, as a loose lip is the elements of foreseeable failure please take note of this all-time, I don’t not want to have any problems towards the end of this transaction due to my position in my bank here in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAlso know that this is a capital investment funds, which was invested by foreigner as details in my emails to you, all documents will be release by my bank as soon as the funds are release in your name , all I need from you is the trust and also let me lead this transaction to avoid any mistakes and without us both seeing and assessing the situation through the same lenses there cannot and will never be success or progress. So, as we say in Filipino “one foot cannot stand on two boats “so a decisive and clear mind is what is needed here. I need you to follow and adhere to my every instruction and do exactly as I will advise for success to be gained. You must let me direct this project for us to have achieved the step by step anticipated procedures to ensure the success, and I want to assure you that there is no possibility of law prosecution for us for any reason, this is an issue of Investment funds and the attorney will prepare the necessary paperwork which shall legally put you in place as the bona-fide beneficiary to receiving the money in your names, he will obtain the necessary clearances which will cover all the aspects involved in this transaction from the Philippines authorities including the Justice department here. I have been a professional banker for many years and I know perfectly how the system works here.\r\n\r\nI will also be very forthright with you as per the process and cost. We have to embrace the reality that this transaction would cost a limited amount of money because I will not want a situation where you see that as we are in the process of making this take the semblance of a legitimate transaction that you are not financially able to support.\r\n\r\nI must be honest with you so we do not waste each other’s time, there is no way you and I will partner in this operation without spending money, it is not possible.  A transaction of this magnitude must be expensive to execute. If we say we aren't spending money, then we are not ready, and the transaction would be looking us in the face, and no progress made because it is capital intensive. I do not want to hide anything from you because I equally do not like surprises. It is better you know and back out now, than for me to lead you on and then start bringing up surprises. You and I will spend money to get this deal done. The opening an account with an offshore bank in your name for the initial receipt of these funds before you start moving it in safe bit to your home account will be your full responsibility.\r\n\r\nAt this time, I do not have any access to the big money in question, so all documentations of claim I will be filing in your name as the beneficiary would be done from my personal pocket. I will be paying for it all. I am taking upon myself all other expenses - (Documentations fees, Attorney retainer fees, fee for filing application for a grant of all required documents and transfer fees to be charged to move the entire funds from my bank, local travel expenses, not to mention miscellaneous expenses). I shall take care of all expenses at my end; please you should be able to take care of all expenses at your end in having your offshore account ready in your name to receive these funds, If you find this impossible to handle, then we can close this topic immediately but please, do not destroy me because of this sensitive information I have divulged to you.\r\n\r\nI have set some amount aside and would like you to do the same. I honestly don’t want to bring you into a transaction to inconvenience you, but to expose you to wealth, that before now might not have aspired to attain. I imagine that you might not be comfortable with the reality that it will cost money as like every other being we desire windfall without considering the hard challenge that might be required. In my calculation I have proposed to cater for the expenses, you might say that I am unsympathetic in exposing you to reality but I tell you I am a good man that works for results. I do not want a situation where we are emotionally alleviated and in the end we are downtrodden with disenchantment resulting from a deadlock created by lack of funds.\r\n\r\nWe must plan and clearly express the manner we truly believe we can attain a 100% risk free actualization. This in my view is the honest position. Please feel free to express yourself without any reservations.  I hope we are able to agree. Once we are confident, we would be able to shoulder all the responsibilities that we envisage we can go ahead, with me investing on the paper work with my funds and as we go on towards completion and my resources get consumed you can deploy your financial support. It is also possible that my resources can provide for everything.\r\n\r\nOPTION 1:\r\nI am presently investigating an offshore bank that has a very close correspondent relationship with my bank, so you will need to open an online/offshore account in your name with this offshore bank. So that once the funds are released, they will be moved straight into the offshore bank account, and secured for both of us. After which you can begin to transfer our various shares in safe bits into our designated personal bank accounts as I will direct.\r\n\r\nOPTION 2:\r\nOnce the funds are released by my bank, I can arrange for them to be moved to our affiliate security/finance company in Europe, but in this case, your physical presence will be needed to sign the release document. If required, the security company will release the funds to you, assist you in setting up an account with any bank of your choice, and ensure a smooth deposit of the entire funds into the bank account, and then you can begin to transfer our various shares in safe bits into our designated personal bank accounts.\r\n\r\nI am ready to invest my share in real estate and hotels and resorts or any lucrative investment in your country or neighbouring countries. My friend, please let us be positive and show discretion as we both make one of the most fruitful steps of our lives. I will also appreciate you tell me more about yourself, family and business.\r\nIf you are interested in my proposal kindly transmit your information to enable us proceed i.e\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Your Full Name\r\n  2.  Address:\r\n  3.  Tel No. (mobile preferably)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask me before we proceed. NOTE: For security purposes in our email correspondence, I would appreciate that you input this code: [CIF-M3T] in all email messages directed to me.\r\n\r\nAttached is the bio-data page of my international passport .\nBest regards,\r\nGerry B V (Mr)\r\n[CIF-M3T]"

        "body": "Dear Lori,\r\n\r\nThanks for your prompt response.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.\r\n  Under this Direct investment Capital Fund, Investing companies or individual do not necessarily have to buy regular shares of a company's stock. Direct investment provides a company with capital funding. In return investors get a long-term equity interest. The most common way to repay investors is through dividends. Dividends are payments made to shareholders out of a company's profits. They can be paid out in cash or in shares of stock, and they're typically paid out on a quarterly basis.\r\n\r\n\r\n         2. As indicated in my previous correspondence, all the cost will be on me, except the opening and activation of the on-line                   bank account will be strictly personal to you and your responsibility.\r\n\r\n          3.  This is necessary as it will seem an in-house affair and will not attract fund movement monitoring agencies. And from\r\n                this account you will gradually move the fund in safe bits to your home account.\r\n\r\n         4.  I think not later than 10 banking days will be enough to finalize this transaction. That is, 10 banking days after the receipt\r\n               of the bank coordinates of the new account, you will open and operate.\r\n\r\nIf these is ok by you, transmit your detail and lets proceed.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day.\nBest regards,\r\nGerry B V (Mr)\r\n[CIF-M3T]"
