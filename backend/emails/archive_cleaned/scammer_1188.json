Can you tell me more about this situation? How did the Office of the President of Nigeria come to believe that I was deceased?\n\nI'm also curious about this fund you mentioned. Could you provide more details about it? What is its purpose and why was my name associated with it in the first place?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nGale"
