        "body": "Attention:  Rebecca.\r\n\r\n\r\nSometimes i do wonder if you are really, really with yourself. How could you keep trusting people and at the end you will lose your hard-earned money, or are you being deceived by their big names? they impersonate on many offices, claiming to be Governors, Director/ Chairmen of one office or the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir game plan is only just to extort your hard-earned money. Now, the question is how long will you continue to be deceived? Sometimes ,they will issue you fake check, ATM CARD, introduce you to fake diplomatic delivery, UN-existing on-line banking and they will also fake wire transfer of your fund with payment stop order.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyway, the virtue of my position, i have been following this transaction from inception and all your efforts towards realizing the fund. More often than not,  it is very unfortunate that at the end you lose. Also using someone came to their office to claim your fund or you authorized someone as your representative to draw your attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough, i don't blame you because you are not here to witness the processing of your payment. The problem here is that you've never been told the whole truth about this transaction and it is because of this truth they decided to extort you, the keeping collecting money from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most annoying part is even fraudsters have really taken advantage of this opportunity to enrich themselves at your expense; those you feel are assisting or working for you are your main problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know the truth surrounding this payment and i am the only person who will deliver you from this long suffering if you will abide by my advice .Please i beseech you to stop pursuit of shadows and being deceived. Feel free to contact me immediately you receive this mail so that I can explain to you the modus-operandi guiding the release of your payment. Do not panic or have fear for anything, i know you have gone through hell but time has come to reap.\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all i need from you is trust, just give me the trust all your information is here with me, because i have work in UN office for over 8 years both in Africa and UK and there is no means of receiving payment that cost anything except Court affidavit of claim of fund certificate if the owner is not there in person, which will not cost more than $1, 750 USD.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, all the fees they ask both transfer cost or delivering cost, clearance certificates known of them exist. If you really want us to proceed, send me your direct contact or you ignore my letter if you are not interested.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must to be truthful and straightforward to you. Truth is bitter but I will always live with it since I was brought up with it. Think twice and have a change of mind so that you will archive our aim. I will give you more details as soon as i get your respond.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Janet Olisa\r\n\r\n\r\n(Director Of Ministry Of Foreign Payments) MINISTRY OF FOREIGN\r\n\r\nAFFAIRS, HEADQUATERS – ABUJA."

It seems like there are many things happening that I wasn't aware of.\n\nYou mentioned something about fake checks, ATM cards, and wire transfers. Could you please elaborate more on these? How can one identify if they're fake or not?\n\nAlso, you talked about people claiming to be Governors or Directors. That sounds very serious! How does one verify the authenticity of such individuals?\n\nI'm also curious about the process you mentioned - the one that I'm not here to witness. Could you explain what this process involves?\n\nLastly, you mentioned a fee for a Court affidavit of claim of fund. Is this a standard procedure? And why would it only apply if the owner is not present?\n\nI appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRebecca"
