        "body": "Hello T. Friedman,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must admit, your message has caught my attention. It's intriguing to hear that there is a fund of million US dollars waiting for me in your bank. Can you please provide more details about how this fund came about and why it was awarded to me by The United Nations and the European Union Government?\n\nI'm also curious about the required fee you mentioned. Could you explain what this fee is for and why it needs to be paid? Additionally, could you clarify the options of sending the fee through a bitcoin wallet, Apple tunes card, or Steam Approved fund? How do these methods work?\n\nLastly, I would appreciate more information on the ATM card or cashier check option. How would that process work and what are the benefits of choosing either of those options?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nBetty"
