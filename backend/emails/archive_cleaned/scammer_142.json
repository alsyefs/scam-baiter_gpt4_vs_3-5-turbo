I understand your concern about how the payment became overdue, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused.\n\nThe delay in your payment was due to the actions of previous government officials who failed to comply with the directive to release your funds. However, with the new government in place, they have recognized this issue and are working towards rectifying it.\n\nThe World Bank unit has been involved in this process to ensure transparency and fairness. They have reviewed your case and deemed you eligible for the payment that has been long awaited. Their role is to oversee the proper disbursement of funds and prevent any further delays or mishandling.\n\nTo proceed with the payment, I kindly request you to provide me with some necessary information. This includes your full name, country address, phone number, current occupation, age, marital status, and the name of your next of kin. Once I receive these details, I will forward them to THE FIRST BANK NIGERIA PLC for further processing.\n\nPlease be assured that my office is committed to ensuring a smooth and successful resolution to this matter. Feel free to ask any additional questions or concerns you may have.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nShellie"
