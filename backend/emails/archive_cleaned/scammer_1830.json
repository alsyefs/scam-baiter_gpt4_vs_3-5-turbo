It's quite interesting to meet someone from South Sudan, I've always wanted to learn more about different cultures and countries.\n\nYou mentioned that there are some ideas you'd like to share with me? I'm all ears! Please feel free to share them with me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"
