        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the concern and effort put forth by the BRITISH High Commission in addressing this issue. It's comforting to know that such measures are being taken to rectify the situation.\n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts of your message, though. Could you please clarify what exactly is meant by \"Bank draft\"? Also, could you explain more about how the USA Country was abolished due to activities noticed?\n\nFurthermore, I would like to understand better how buying a steam wallet or Google play card from an apple office or Walmart office would help in this situation? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
