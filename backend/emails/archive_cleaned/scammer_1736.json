        "body": "Hello Mr. John Sloshar,\n\nThank you for your message and the information provided. It's quite interesting to hear about this unanimous agreement between the High Court of Thailand and the Siam Commercial Bank.\n\nI'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify what this is all about? I don't recall having any dealings with the High Court of Thailand or the Siam Commercial Bank. \n\nAlso, you mentioned a form that needs to be filled out and returned, but I didn't see any attached to your message. Could you kindly resend it?\n\nLastly, regarding the payment you mentioned, could you provide more details on what exactly this fee is for? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
