It's always sad when someone passes away without their affairs in order.\n\nI'm a bit surprised that you've contacted me about this matter, though. How did you come across my contact information? And why do you believe I could be the next of kin to the deceased?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarilyn"
