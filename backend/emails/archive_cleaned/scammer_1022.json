However, I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message.\n\nYou mentioned something about an inheritance fund and a payment schedule list. Could you please elaborate more on these? How did my name appear on this list?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that I should not respond to any other offices but yours. May I know why this is so? \n\nI noticed that there are several codes and numbers included in your message. What are these for? And how do they relate to the payment process?\n\nLastly, you mentioned a fee of USD for confirmation of my payment. Could you explain what this fee is for and why it's necessary?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nEric"
