Could you please provide me with more details about this payment? I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of the situation before proceeding.\n\nAlso, could you clarify who Scott is and what his role is in this matter? I don't recall making any agreements with him, so it would be helpful to know more about his involvement.\n\nI appreciate your prompt response and look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPaula"
