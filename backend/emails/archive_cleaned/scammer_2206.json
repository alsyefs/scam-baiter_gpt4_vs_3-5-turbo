        "body": "WELCOME TO RIA MONEY TRANSFER\nDESK OF Rev. Phillip Adams, Esq\nE-mail \nriamoney.transfer@inbox.ru\nhttp: // www. riamoneytransfer.com/\nWhatsApp number: +229 55938766\nDear Friend,\nI want to make you understand something in life that you failed to realise. I want you to have at the back of your mind that all this while you have been dealing with fake people, claiming to be western union/moneygram and bank officials, I have never slept a day without being worried about your issue since I entered into this custody of Ria Money Transfer. I have been keeping this a secret, but I want to open up to you at this very moment to avoid judgement day in the presence of Almighty God.\n Do you really know what holding your payment over and over and paying your earned money without result is because of the Certificate of Occupancy?\n Look, I want you to do me a favour by keeping this issue secret.\nFor your sake, just to be honest, I am praying day and night for this case. Once I saw my eyes on your contract compensation award winner, you spent a lot and yet reached no conclusion. I believed that God would use someone to save somebody. As a matter of fact, I hope that this transfer has come to an end for you to receive your payment. As I took this bold step, what I mostly needed from you was honesty and integrity, as well as keeping this secret and confidential.\nRight now, this might interest you to know the main reason why I keep on exposing the below reference issue to you today, just to be aware of what really holds your payment upon all the monies you have paid: a Certificate of Occupancy. Without the document, there are no ways contract award winner compensation will ever be paid to you. Point of correction: don't ever ignore the below messages; it is your time for God to answer your prayer. Well, I wouldn't say I regretted taking such a step because I don't know how much you have also paid so far on this issue. But my pain and agonies are much greater each time I see your file-form record. You're always feeling cheated or swindled.\nWell, sometimes I sit down and think of this the other way around, with the firm belief that you sometimes act funny just because of the bad name and reputation of this country (Benin Republic in Africa) and also because of your past experience with some of those hoodlums. But when I sat down in my office sometime last week and saw your payment file, I was trying to contact you personally with the hope of helping you out of the mess you have faced so far with those criminals, but I still partially understand that you are still somewhat believing in those hoodlums fake letters and documents. Look, you need a prayer. Just ask God to open your eyes well by reviewing a personal person to trust in order to have your fund paid to you.\nConsidering the state of affairs at hand, I will be glad to notify you for the last time what holding your payment sake and you have also lost money too, but I want you to know our stands now because the UN, FBI, and INTERPOL are so concerned why I have not yet gotten this fund of yours paid to you since, but I found out that my explanation makes no sense or difference to them; all they are after is for me to make sure I get this done before the end of this week. Please! Please! & please! Can you help yourself out of this matter so we can forget about our agonies once and for all? Can you trust me once for me to trust you as well so we can work things out? I want to be plain to you, so you can be plain to me as well. According to my meeting with this reliable bank manager today,\nHe made it clear to me that instead of him demanding fees upon fees, \nwhy don't you pay the whole needed fee for once and get this fund transferred or delivered immediately to you? If you're ready to comply with the US$153.00 \nFinally,I would love for you to open up to me about whether I should forward a letter of declaration to you for you to sign, stating that you're no longer interested in making this claim, so I can forward it to the bank,UN, FBI, and INTERPOL. But if you're still interested in making the claim, kindly try and send down the needed fee today by Ria Money Transfer so I can make all arrangements with the bank to avoid misunderstandings.\nI await your prompt response,\nRegards,\nRev. Phillip Adams,\nWhatsApp number: +229 55938766\nE-mail: \nriamoneytransfer44@outlook.com\nE-mail: \nria.m92@aol.com"

        "body": "Dear Rev. Phillip Adams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and sharing this information. I appreciate your concern and willingness to help me with my payment issue. It's unfortunate that there have been fake people claiming to be officials from Western Union, MoneyGram, and banks. I understand the importance of honesty and integrity in resolving this matter.\n\nI'm curious to know more about the document you mentioned that is needed for the payment to be released. Could you please provide some details about what this document is and why it is necessary? I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of the situation.\n\nAlso, you mentioned that I need to pay a fee in order to proceed with the payment. Can you please explain why this fee is required and how much it would be? I just want to ensure that everything is transparent before taking any further steps.\n\nThank you again for your assistance, Rev. Phillip Adams. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nArlene"
