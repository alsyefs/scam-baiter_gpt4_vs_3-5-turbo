However, I must apologize as I am not comfortable sharing my home address online due to privacy concerns. \n\nCould you please provide more details about the direct deposit process? How does it work exactly? And is there any other way to receive the deposit without providing my home address?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarianne"
