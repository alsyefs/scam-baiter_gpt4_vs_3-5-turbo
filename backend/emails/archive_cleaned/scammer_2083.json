        "body": "Hello Mrs. Ahlenius,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. It's a pleasure to hear from the United Nations, Office of Oversight Services. I must say, it's quite an honor.\n\nRegarding the fund you mentioned, could you please provide me with more details? I'm not entirely sure what this is about. You see, I don't recall having any overdue payment that needs to be settled.\n\nAlso, could you explain why there is a need for a security keeping fee? And why does it have to be paid through Western Union or Money Gram transfer? Or via iTunes card or Google Play card?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJim"
