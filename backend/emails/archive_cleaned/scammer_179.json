        "body": "Dear Special FBI Agent Bryan A. Vorndran,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the fraudsters in Nigeria. I appreciate your efforts in investigating this matter and ensuring that justice is served. I understand that there is a significant sum of money assigned to my name, and it is disheartening to hear that these fraudsters have been swindling foreigners without any hope of receiving their funds.\n\nI am glad to hear that some arrests have been made in relation to this issue. It must be challenging for you to work under such circumstances, especially with limited time in Nigeria. I assure you that I will respond to your message promptly.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about the arrests made? How many individuals have been apprehended so far? Are they part of a larger criminal network? Additionally, what steps are being taken to ensure the safe return of the funds to their rightful owners?\n\nThank you once again for your dedication and commitment in combating these fraudulent activities. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nEdward"
