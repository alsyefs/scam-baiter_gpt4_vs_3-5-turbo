        "body": "Hello Mr. Folashodun Shonubi,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear about Mr. Shem Pullen claiming to have power of attorney over my funds. I don't recall giving such authorization.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the situation? How did Mr. Pullen come into possession of this power of attorney? And what exactly does he intend to do with my funds?\n\nI would also like to know more about the process involved in transferring these funds and how it affects my online account.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRoosevelt"
