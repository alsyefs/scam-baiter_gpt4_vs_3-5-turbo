Please keep an open mind and be guided by\nunbiased evaluation.. Though, I know that the opportunity I'm about to\ndiscuss with you which is of high magnitude and requiring absolute\nconfidentiality, may come to you as a surprise since we have never met\nor have any record of previous contact... but it is a fact of life\nthat time and chance happens to everyone and this is further espoused\nin the holy book, thus 'the just shall live by faith'. I am also\nassuring you that it shall be a happy ending if we work together in\nfaith and in confidence.\nMy names is Badreldin  Ahmed., a Cousin of Mr. Omar al-Bashir (Former\nPresident of Sudan). I am his close confidant and currently in exile\nin Ghana, west Africa. Mr. Omar al-Bashir made a deposit of\napproximately $75,000,000,00, (Seventy five million US Dollars) in one\nof the banks here in West Africa, and which I'm privileged to exercise\npower of attorney over, as his relative and confidant. As you should\nknow, Mr. Omar al- Bashir is in jail and Sudanese government is\nbeaming its searchlight across Africa for Mr. Omar's loot. The search\nis limited to Africa because Mr. Omar is wanted in the West and he did\nnot keep his money in the West.\nBecause of reasons elucidated above, Mr. Omar al-Bashir instructed\nfrom prison that funds in West African bank should be quickly moved\nout of Africa, and with the assistance and legal erudition of his\nattorney in the UK, and in collaboration with a local lawyer here,\nfunds was successfully evacuated out of Africa to Europe. Mr. Omar\nasked me to shop for a reliable partner to take in funds and have it\ninvested pending his release from prison which no one know for how\nlong as trial has not even started. This is where you come in.\nIt is agreed that upon receipt of funds, you will take 35% of the\nfunds for your efforts and also, wire back 5% to his attorneys and I,\nwhile remainder 60% is invested on any profitable venture on behalf of\nMr. Omar al-Bashir.\nIf you wish that we explore this great opportunity together, please\nkindly revert to me as soon as possible and I will brief you about how\nwe proceed.\nFinally, \nit is a risk-free overture and poses no danger to anyone in\nanyway whatsoever.\n Please, kindly reply to my private email account:\ngaffar.ahmed11@yahoo.com\nBest regards\nBadreldin M. Ahmed"
