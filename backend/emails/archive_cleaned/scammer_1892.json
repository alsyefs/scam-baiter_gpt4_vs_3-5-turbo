        "body": "Dear Mr. Olayemi Cardoso,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me as the new Central Bank Governor of CBN. I appreciate the information you have provided regarding the release of my approved funds. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with any payment method.\n\nFirstly, could you please clarify why the former governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele, was removed and arrested? It would help me understand the situation better.\n\nSecondly, I would like to know more about the CBN Cash Swap payment system. How does it work exactly? Are there any risks involved in using this method?\n\nLastly, if I choose to receive the funds through the CBN Customized Business ATM Visa Card, how long will it take for me to receive it? Is there any tracking number or confirmation that will be provided?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed with claiming my approved sum.\n\nBest wishes,\nLouise"
