I use to head the Accounts\ndepartment in my bank head office, but last December I was asked to take\nposition of a Manager of our branch in Great Winchester St, London, PO Box\n548\nLeeds LS1 1WU, so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered a\nfortune.\nAs I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of Â£10,500,000:00\n(TEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED BRITAIN POUNDS) that has not been operated on for\nthe past 7 years now. From my investigation today, I have found out that\nthis\naccount belongs to one Late Mr Morris Thompson an American great\nindustrialist\nand a resident of Alaska, who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash\nof Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including\nhis\nwife and only daughter.\nYou shall read more news about the crash on visiting this site which I got\nduring my investigation;\nhttp:/ /archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list\nThis account is in dormant account in my bank here and no other person knows\nabout this account or any thing concerning it, I have kept a close\nmonitoring\nof the account, and since then nobody has come forward to ask about the\nmoney\nas next of kin to the late Morris Thompson, meaning that no one is aware of\nthe account.\nI cannot directly take out this money without the help of a foreigner and\nthat\nis why I am contacting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it\nwith me.\nAs the Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release\nof\nthe funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account,\nwith the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you\nimmediately i received your contact information, such as:\n1) Your Name:.......................................\n2) Your Address:.................................\n3) Your Phone Number:......................\n4) Your Occupation and Age:..............\nI am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin to the\naccount, so that my bank head quarters will release the funds to us. There\nis\npractically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a\nlegitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law.\nPlease contact me immediately with your private telephone number so we can\ngo\nover the details and Please do not expose this deal if you are not\ninterested\nbecause if you do, it will take me out of seat. And for your interest to do\nthis business with me kindly reply ASAP and call me.\nRegards,\nMr.Kemi Dinah.     "

I must say, it's not every day that one receives a message like this. \n\nI'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate fate of Mr. Morris Thompson and his family. It's always sad when lives are lost in such tragic circumstances.\n\nYou mentioned that you need assistance to claim the funds and share them. Could you please elaborate on what kind of assistance you require? Also, how did you come across my contact information?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nGlen"
