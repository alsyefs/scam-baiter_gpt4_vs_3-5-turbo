I'm really grateful for your efforts in tracking down those impostors.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind me asking. How was my name selected for this compensation? And how did these impostors manage to scam people like me? Also, could you please explain the process of receiving this compensation?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDenise"
