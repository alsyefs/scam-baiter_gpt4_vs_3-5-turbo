It was discovered that your name, identity, and email were currently used to transfer and invest the total sum of $51,000,000.00(Fifty One Million United States Dollars) in the Settlement Bank of United States and the dividend currently running up to $300,000.00 (Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which is a total of $51,300,000.00( Fifty One Million, three thousand United States Dollars)We have all the document here to confirm this claim.\nNow the questions are, how as not at any time been notified either by email or letter by any medical practitionecan a dead man be actively involved in fund investment without the presence of the next of kin who is supposed to be the signatory?  Secondly, could this lawyer be trying to play a smart one? and lastly but not the least, This office hr certifying your deceased state or any document issued by any member of your family or from a registrar of vital statistics that declares the date, location, and cause of your death.\nWe have tried severally to reach-out to you by sending emails to your address and several attempted calls made, but all have so far proved abortive, hence this office is left with no other option than to send this reminder message to your email ones again, as we would not accept to be held liable for any loss of your rights and fund to a wrong person. If you are still alive, do respond with your form of identification for final confirmation without delays, as we have already informed the bank that the real beneficiary of the fund may likely still be alive without even realizing what the lawyer whom so much was entrusted to have been up to.\n \nKind Regards\nLaura sahar, \nMr. JÃ¼rgen Stock,\nNew Secretary-General of the International\nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL)\nINTERPOL (General Secretariat)   "

        "body": "Hello Laura Sahar and Mr. Jurgen Stock,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding this matter. I must say, I am quite surprised by the information you have shared. It is indeed strange that someone would be using my name and identity for such significant financial transactions without my knowledge.\n\nI understand your concerns about the lawyer's actions and their attempt to change the ownership of the funds. Could you please provide more details about the evidence they presented regarding my supposed death? Is there any way for me to verify this information independently?\n\nAdditionally, I appreciate your efforts in trying to contact me through email and phone calls. I apologize if I have been difficult to reach. Can you please confirm which email address and phone number you have been using to contact me? It's possible that there may have been some technical issues or misunderstandings.\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how we can resolve this situation.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"
