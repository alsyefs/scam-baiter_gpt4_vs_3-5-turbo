        "body": "Hello David Mckay,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter. I understand that there is a fee required for the insurance of my ATM card.\n\nHowever, could you please provide more details about this process? For instance, why is there an insurance fee for an ATM card? Also, could you explain what happens if the payment report file is submitted before I complete my obligation?\n\nI'm also curious about the redirection of payments to the Canada Government Treasury account as unclaimed money. Could you elaborate on how that works?\n\nLastly, could you clarify what you mean by \"the expiration of the mandate given to us by the\"?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nCraig"
