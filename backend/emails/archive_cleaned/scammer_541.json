        "body": "CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA\nCREDIT CONTROL & WIRE TRANSFER UNIT\nTINUBU SQUARE, LAGOS NIGERIA\nAttn:Fund Beneficiary,\nI am of the idea that some cruel individuals have been sitting on your payment after you have satisfactorily fulfilled the obligations required to receive your contract sum.\nAsk yourself this question. Do these individuals observe humans rights? Do they see you as a client that is clamoring for his payment and deserves to be paid?. Some do contact you promising what they cannot do and allow you to waste your money showing no feeling of humanity.\nMake a serious U- turn now and give me attention and I will release the payment to you to your surprise. The right channel does not take time.\nAll you need to do is to promise me a percentage of the total contract sum US$10.5 Million and I will make your dream come true. You don't need to stress yourself any longer.\nThe following are my working tools:\n1. CONFIDENTIALITY: You must not divulge any information regarding my strategy to release the fund to you within a couple of days to any individual(s) you were transacting with previously no matter how friendly you might think you are with the person(s) as they are snakes under the green grass but you don't know.\n2. TRUSTWORTHINESS:You are going to receive this fund now, I am sure. Your YES must YES and your NO must be NO. The percentage we may agree on must be given to me immediately you confirm the whole fund in your bank account.\nShould I commence?. If yes, respond to me.\nAccept my best wishes for the season and God bless.\nYours Faithfully.\nDr.Jomo Adams.\nNew Banking Reform Executive\nCentral Bank of Nigeria(CBN)"

        "body": "Hello Adams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it has certainly piqued my interest. \n\nI understand that you're suggesting a strategy to release some funds, but could you please elaborate more on this? What exactly does this process entail? And what kind of percentage are we talking about here?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the nature of these funds. Where do they come from and why are they currently held up?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJanice"
