        "body": "  Dear Beneficiary\nRef No: CBN/101/134/2023\nI 'm the telegraphic transfers programming software officer solely in charge of all Telex (KTT) transfers   with the Central Bank of Nigeria,  . I found out your fund has been on hold due to logistics and corruption by the offices and officers handling your file   I am also aware of some top government officials at the Presidency and Finance Ministry sitting on your FUND approval  with a view to  divert the fund  to their personal account when all your efforts to get your fund have been frustrated with numerous (sic) demands and requests for payments.\nBut as an insider and the head of the Telex section I have an answer for you. It will take me just three working days to secure a diskette for the Telex transfer of your fund, that is if you are ready to collaborate with me. This will be against every other arrangement already made . You don't need an attorney to represent you , all I need from you is to assist me to buy a replaceable Apple Telex  diskette { A.T.D } and accept my conditions and abide by it.\nYou know this is a very big risk which I am prepared to take, because I intend to leave Nigeria within one month of executing the transfer due to the political situation in Nigeria at the moment. I will not be coming back for a long time.\nMy conditions are:\n1. You will guarantee to give me 10% of the Fund one week after you have received and confirmed the money in your account. And after you have received the fund you will pay for my wife and son and daughter air ticket out of Nigeria to Toronto Canada.\nFinally, you must maintain absolute secrecy and confidentiality by not communicating with any other person or disclosing this arrangement to another person. Contact me on the direct email address  below  . I  will expect your reply immediately with your direct telephone number for better and secured communications.\nYours Sincerely\nDavid  Weisenfeld\nemail: \ndavidweisefeld1@gmail.com\nForeign Transfer & Telex Dept.\nCentral Bank of Nigeria\nAbuja - Headquarters   "

        "body": "Dear David Weisenfeld,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the transfer of my funds. I appreciate your willingness to assist me in this matter. However, I have a few questions before we proceed.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the Telex transfer process? I am not familiar with it and would like to understand how it works.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that there are some government officials involved in corruption. Can you elaborate on this? How can I be assured that my funds will be transferred safely and without any further complications?\n\nLastly, I understand that you need assistance in purchasing an Apple Telex diskette. Could you explain why this is necessary and how it relates to the fund transfer process?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAngie"
