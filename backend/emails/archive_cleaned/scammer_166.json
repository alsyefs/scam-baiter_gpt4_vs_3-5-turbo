        "body": "Hello Attorney Brad Smith,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope you are doing well. I appreciate you providing me with this information about the deposit that my name apparently matches with one of the Next of Kin mentioned by your late client, Dr. Jean.\n\nI must admit, this is quite surprising to hear. Could you please provide me with more details about the deposit and how exactly I am connected to it? I want to make sure that everything is clear before proceeding further.\n\nAdditionally, could you explain the process we would need to follow in order to retrieve and transfer the funds? It's important for me to understand the steps involved and any legal requirements that need to be met.\n\nThank you once again for contacting me. I look forward to your response and further guidance on this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nMargaret"
