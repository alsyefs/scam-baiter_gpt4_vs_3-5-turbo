However, I have a few questions before proceeding with providing my information.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the European Union Reps and United Nations Executive Committee on Lottery Winnings? How are they related to the delivery of my funds?\n\n2. Could you explain how the funds were received from the Monetary Fund IMF? What is their involvement in this process?\n\n3. Is there any specific reason why the funds are being delivered through an ATM Master Card? Are there any fees or charges associated with using this card?\n\n4. Can you clarify what you mean by \"another US will be activated and sent to me as well\"? Are you referring to another payment or additional funds?\n\nI look forward to your response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
