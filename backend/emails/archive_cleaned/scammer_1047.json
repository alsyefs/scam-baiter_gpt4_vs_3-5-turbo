I must say, it's not every day that one receives such an offer.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please tell me more about the SECURITY COMPANY? What is their name and where are they based? Also, how did you come across my contact information?\n\nYou mentioned a portfolio code number, but I didn't see any specific number in your message. Could you please clarify that for me?\n\nLastly, could you explain what 'demurrage' means? I'm not familiar with this term.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Mark Paul,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite an interesting situation you've described here. I'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, could you explain why the fund is being delivered in a black portfolio? Is there any specific reason for this method of delivery?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that the bank transfer would cost a certain amount of US dollars. Could you provide more details about this? Why is there such a fee and who exactly requires it?\n\nLastly, regarding the SECURITY COMPANY, could you tell me more about them? What is their name and where are they based? \n\nI appreciate your patience in answering these questions. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"
