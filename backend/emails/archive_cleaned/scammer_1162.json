It's really exciting to hear that I've legally won such a large sum of money from a Lottery Company outside the United States of America. \n\nI'm curious about this newly developed technology Monitoring Network System you mentioned. How does it work? And how was my email address selected?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the CERTIFIED BANK DRAFT? How will it be delivered to me and what do I need to do once I receive it?\n\nYou mentioned some fees that need to be paid for Deposit Fee IMF CLEARANCE and Shipping Fee. Could you provide more details on these charges? Why can't they be deducted from the winning prize?\n\nLastly, who is Mr. James Smith?
