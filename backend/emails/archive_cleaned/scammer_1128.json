It's really kind of you to reach out and help me with this.\n\nI'm curious though, how did you come across my information? And why are these top bank officials and government officials interested in my fund? Also, could you please explain a bit more about the process of confirming the funds in my account?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nPedro"
