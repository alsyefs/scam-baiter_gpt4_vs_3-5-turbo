        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have provided. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further. Can you please clarify how my name and the value of the boxes were determined? Also, what is the reason behind delivering cash in a box instead of using more secure methods like bank transfers?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know more about the verification process. How can I be sure that Mr. Eric Powa is indeed a legitimate diplomatic agent? Is there any official documentation or identification that he can provide?\n\nI apologize for my cautious approach, but it's important for me to ensure the safety and legitimacy of any transactions. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nBest wishes,\nTyler"
