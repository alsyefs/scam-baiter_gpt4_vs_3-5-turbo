However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the signed wire transfer fee? What is the purpose of this fee and how much is it? Additionally, can you explain why the Western Union Money Transfer director management wants to divert my funds to the government treasury account?\n\nI want to ensure that I fully understand the situation before making any decisions. Thank you for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nCatherine"
