It's heartwarming to know that organizations like the Federal Reserve Bank and the United Nations are working together to help people.\n\nCould you please tell me more about how this Covid Palliative Funds program works? How was it decided who would receive these funds? And what is the process for receiving them?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDale"
