        "body": "Dear Felix Akpan Esq,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the unfortunate passing of Mr. Farhad Bahir. I'm sorry to hear about his demise. I appreciate you taking the time to contact me and explain the situation.\n\nI understand that you are looking for assistance in handling the funds and property left behind by your client. It must be a challenging task, especially when there are no known relatives available. I'm curious to know more about the legal documents you mentioned that can support any claims made.\n\nCould you please provide further details on how this process would work? What would be my role as the next of kin and what steps would need to be taken to ensure everything is done legitimately? Additionally, are there any potential risks or challenges that we should be aware of?\n\nThank you again for considering me for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJanet"
