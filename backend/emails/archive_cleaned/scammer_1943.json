        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have shared regarding the Monetary Fund IMF and the transfer of funds via Western Union Money Transfer. However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about why my email address was found in the scam victim's list? I want to ensure that this is a legitimate transaction and not a scam itself. Additionally, could you explain how the funds will be transferred to me through Western Union Money Transfer on a daily basis?\n\nFurthermore, I would like to know what specific information you require from me in order to proceed with the transfer. Could you please clarify what you mean by \"we can not be able to send the payment with your email address\"?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDennis"
