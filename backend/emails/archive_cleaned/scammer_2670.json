        "body": "Hello Mr. Peter F. Stanton,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about this fund approval. I must say, it's quite a surprise! \n\nI'm curious, how did my name come up for this payment from the United States Government? Also, could you please explain more about the Treasury Department ACT Section on Automated Wire Transfer? I'm not very familiar with these financial terms.\n\nRegarding the TAXATION FEES OF 1% OF $200 Million, is there a specific reason why this fee cannot be deducted from the total amount before transferring it to me?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
