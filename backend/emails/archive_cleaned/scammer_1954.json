        "body": "Hello Barrister Fred E. Morgan,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and explaining the situation in such detail. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about this payment file worth millions of dollars. \n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in relation to this payment? And could you please explain more about what the Release Approval Order RAOC is? I'm not familiar with these financial terms.\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about the process of transferring such a large sum into my bank account or receiving an ATM Master Card. How does that work exactly?\n\nLastly, you mentioned a fee of US dollars that needs to be paid through Money gram Money Transfer or Ria transfer. Could you provide more details on how I can make this payment?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMelissa"
