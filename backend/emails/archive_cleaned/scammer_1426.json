        "body": "Hello Mrs Kim,\n\nThank you for your prompt response and the detailed information. It's really kind of you to consider opening an online banking account in my name at Absa Bank. That sounds like a convenient way to manage the funds.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit curious about how this process works. Could you please explain more about it? How does the bank ensure the security of such transactions? And what measures are taken to maintain privacy?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRamona"
