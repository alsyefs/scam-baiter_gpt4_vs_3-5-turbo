It's quite unexpected to receive such news, but I'm open to hearing more about it.\n\nBefore I provide any personal information or take any further steps, could you please clarify a few things for me? Firstly, what exactly is this package that the United Nations has chosen for me? Secondly, how did they come to know about my generosity and help to mankind? Lastly, can you explain why it is necessary for me to provide my full name, contact details, passport information, and the nearest airport?\n\nI appreciate your understanding and look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeroy"
