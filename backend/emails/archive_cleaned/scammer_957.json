        "body": "Hello Tracy Vorman,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your persistence in trying to help me with my payment. However, I have a few questions before I proceed.\n\nCould you please explain to me why the payment processing fee has been changed to an Apple Gift Card? How does using an Apple Gift Card help with the bank processing of my payment?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the documents you mentioned? What kind of documents will be sent to me once the bank payment processing fee is paid?\n\nI just want to make sure that everything is clear before I proceed. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nBest wishes,\nEugene"
