        "body": "Dearest  Samuel\r\n\r\nI thank you for your prompt response to my mail, i was touched spiritually\r\nand physically to connect you, with great feelings that you may be a great\r\nhelp to me and use this money to do the work of GOD for the less\r\nprivileges, because whosoever that works in GOD'S vain yard, GOD will also\r\nwork on his own. I am a very positive believer and my intuitions have never\r\ndeceived me before.About the St Andrews Missionary Home,it was my late\r\nhusband that warned me to donate some money to them because it is where he\r\nhas been donating when he was alive. As a result,I have the absolute\r\nconviction that you will neither betray me nor disappoint me for my\r\nwishes,rather I am very hopeful that you will give all the maximum\r\nassistance needed to realize this FUND into your account.\r\n\r\nFor my nationality,I am from Austria and my husband and I run a gold\r\nbusiness here in Burkina Faso.\r\n\r\nYou may not know the weight of Joy you have brought to my life on this sick\r\nbed and i pray that this joy will never depart from your life and that of\r\nyour family because it really took me time,knowing that i have lost the\r\nability to do anything by myself or move about, even in my condition before\r\ncontacting you because i cannot imagine my self leaving my sweat in this\r\nlife with the Bank without it reaching the down cast, the motherless and\r\nthe orphans because i am one\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not ignorant of the way you will trust some people and they will\r\nindulge in the act of betraying one's trust forgetting that God is watching\r\nbut I strongly believe in you that you will not disappoint me when you will\r\nreceive this deposit from the Bank. I intended to build a Charity Home in\r\nmy name, YVONNE BOLTON CHARITY FOUNDATION with the fund deposit, which of\r\ncourse can no longer be fulfilled because of the deteriorating state of my\r\nhealth. Now, I want you to collect this fund and help me dispatch it to\r\ncharity organizations. I will therefore be happy when you will reply me\r\nfurnishing me with your contact details orderly like:\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR FULL NAME.......................\r\nYour Current Addresses...............\r\nCountry or base presently...........\r\nYour telephone numbers..........\r\nOccupation/Position.......\r\nA Scan of Your Passport\r\n\r\nImmediately I receive this information, I will give you the Bank Contact\r\nfor you to contact them for the fund transfer to your account, while I go\r\nfor my operation, which I don't know what will be my faith.\r\n\nYour Sick Sister,\r\nMrs. Yvonne C. Bolton"
