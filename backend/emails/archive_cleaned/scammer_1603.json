I received your message regarding the funds that have been sent to me by Mrs. Schuller, my business partner.\n\nI appreciate your assistance in helping me receive these funds. Could you please provide me with more details on how I can go about receiving the money? What are the requirements and procedures involved in either receiving a check or using Money Gram office for the transfer?\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what you mean by \"Bit by Bit\" via outlet Money Gram office? I am not familiar with this term and would like to understand it better.\n\nThank you once again for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
