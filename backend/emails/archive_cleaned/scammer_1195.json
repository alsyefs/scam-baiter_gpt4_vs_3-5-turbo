        "body": "Hello Carrick Jefferson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your concern regarding the change of name and account details. However, I must clarify that I have not authorized any such changes. It is alarming to hear that someone has requested a change in my bank account details without my knowledge.\n\nCould you please provide more information about the situation? How did you come across this unauthorized request? What steps can be taken to stop these criminals from accessing my funds? I would appreciate any guidance or assistance you can offer in resolving this matter.\n\nLooking forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJoann"
