        "body": "Compliments of the season!\nDear Esteemed Beneficiary            \n \nMy Name is Mr. Tom Stevenson. I was once a victim of a scam for years, in fact I traveled to different countries in pursuit of my funds and lost all my savings and my company became completely bankrupt and my life almost became miserable.\n \nI lost hope in every one including calls I receive and mails from lots of people pretending to be of help demanding for all kinds of documents was requested and I was meant to pay for them, but I was shocked to find out that all the documents/Paper works are fake that was why my efforts were in vain.\n \nGracefully I was very fortunate to come across Mr. Ricardo Saias - Partner - CV Advisors LLC who now explained to me things I never knew that have kept me in a serious financial plight. He told me that it's very wrong for a bank or other important ministries in charge of finance to have direct contact with customers/beneficiaries.\n \nThat it is compulsory for the beneficiary to have a genuine and reliable financial advisor who will stand on his/her behalf to secure all documents and then post them to the owner for proper endorsement for swift transfer of their payments.\n \nThough after his explanation I still did not believe him because I am already in a state of confusion not knowing whom to believe any more but he was honest enough to tell me that all the documents I have been spending my hard earn money are no more necessary and not to be paid for the United Nation has enacted just one document called (ICJ Universal Protection Certificate) for effective release of unclaimed funds.\nHe also assures me that he will not charge me for his professional services until when I have officially received my fund, but that \nI will have to take care of \"ICJ Universal Protection Certificate document \nas demanded by United Nation \"that clears all unclaimed funds and transactions for official release, which I did sacrifice to pay for it nothing more.\nThe financial advisor said that due to complaints of unending and unnecessary documentations that the International Court of Justice acting under the United Nations Organization has introduced and enacted into law a document called \"ICJ Universal Protection Certificate document clears all funds and transactions from bureaucratic bottlenecks.\nThe bitter truth is that I was surprised to receive the original ICJ Universal Protection Certificate in my home and then endorsed it as the Authentic owner of the funds, which I never did all the years I was in pursuit of my funds.\nAfter my proper signature on the certificate I was very shocked for my bank to contact me through my account officer to inform me that my account has been credited with my funds and I instant made a withdrawal to confirm that the transfer was real and by the grace of god I have been able to reestablish my business and family and I am happy today enjoying my retirement so if you sincerely want to receive your payment you are to open communication with details of the financial advisor stated below: .\n \nMr. Ricardo Saias\nNorth Miami Beach, Florida, United States.\nPartner at CV Advisors LLC\nTelephone: +1( 978) 969 5315\nEmail: \nfinancialadvisor@globalsdfa.org\nmail: \nprojectsadvisor@mail.com\n \nPlease do not ignore this letter. Take Advantage of my Letter concerning your payment and Enjoy a Happy Life.\n \nThanks\nMr. Tom Stevenson\nAddress: Valley Fair Mall\n2855 Stevens Creek\nBLVD Suite 2461 Santa Clara\nCA 95050."

        "body": "Hello Mr. Tom Stevenson,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing your experience with me. It sounds like you've been through quite a journey, and I'm glad to hear that you found a solution in the end.\n\nI must admit, I'm not entirely familiar with the ICJ Universal Protection document you mentioned. Could you perhaps explain more about it? How does it work exactly? And how did it help in your case?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about Mr. Ricardo Saias from CV Advisors LLC who helped you out. What kind of services does his company provide? \n\nLooking forward to hearing more from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
