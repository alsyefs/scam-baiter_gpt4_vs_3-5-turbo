        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have provided regarding my package delivery. I apologize for not contacting DHL earlier, as I was unaware of the need to do so.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about the package? What is it that I am expecting to receive? Also, could you clarify what fee needs to be paid to DHL? I want to make sure I have all the necessary information before proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, could you explain why the payment needs to be made using an Apple card specifically? Is there a reason for this preference?\n\nI look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
