Could you please explain to me how this process works in simpler terms? \n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a contract fund. What exactly is that? And why has it been approved for me? \n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nP.S: I'm sorry but due to personal reasons, I can't share the details you asked for at the moment.\n\nBest wishes,\nAndre"
