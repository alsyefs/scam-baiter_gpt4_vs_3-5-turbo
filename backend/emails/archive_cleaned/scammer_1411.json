I appreciate your efforts in compensating the scammed victims and ensuring that they receive their settlement. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. How did you obtain my contact information? I'm curious to know how I was selected as one of the recipients for this compensation.\n\n2. Can you provide more details about the United Nations' involvement in this compensation program? What role do they play in overseeing the process?\n\n3. Could you please explain how the ATM Master Card works? Are there any fees or charges associated with using it? And what security measures are in place to protect my funds?\n\nI look forward to your response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nJesse"
