        "body": "Hello Austin,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite surprising to hear that I've been listed as a scam victim and that there's a fund waiting for me. Can you please explain more about how this process works? \n\nAlso, could you clarify how my name ended up on the payment schedule list? I don't recall ever reporting any scams or frauds. \n\nI'm also curious about the tracking number you mentioned. Is it supposed to be included in your message? Because I couldn't find it.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
