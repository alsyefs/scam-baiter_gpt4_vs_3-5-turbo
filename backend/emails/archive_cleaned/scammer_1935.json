(SAN) Director Of Foreign Debts Settlements Of the\nInternational Court of Justice\nDear:  Unpaid Beneficiary\nI have inquired deeper to come to the conclusion that few powerful\nindividuals are behind this dastardly act without due notice to you.\nAs it stands now, you will certainly encounter enormous problems to\nconvince members of the International Court of Justice that you have\nnot been served with required number of notices before assets could be\nforfeited to government.The committee was set up by the payment\nreconciliation committee to verify and scrutinize all outstanding\ndebts owed to foreign beneficiaries in accordance to the information\nreceived from the United States government and other countries over\nunpaid  huge debts owed to Foreigners.We were made to understand that\nall efforts by your establishment to claim your fund has severally\nbeen frustrated by some corrupt officials of the banks and other\ngovernment agencies. This has resulted in the loss of your hard earned\n money to the said officials for the payment of fictitious charges and\nlevies prior to the transfer of your fund.\nHaving seen your file and my further questioning to the officials of\nthe central bank of Nigeria and ministry of finance as to why your\npayment is still pending reveals the rot and corruption in the\nsystem.The bank officials told me that the reason why you haven't\nreceived your payment is due to your inability to pay for the required\ncharges for transfer of funds to your account. When I asked them  why\nthey didn't deduct the said charges from your principal sum, I was\ngiven the flimsy excuse that you never authorized them to do so.\nWhen I put the question across to them if they ever advised you that\nsuch charges could be deducted from your principal fund,the answer I\ngot was no. Now, if you do not tell this beneficiary that such charges\ncould be deducted from his or her principal fund, how will he or  she\nknow that such options are available for such beneficiaries. From my\ninvestigation I discovered that these bank officials deliberately\nrefused to let the charges be deducted from your principal fund\nbecause they want your fund to remain trapped in the bank, while they\ncontinue to extort money from beneficiaries under some flimsy  excuse.\nYou do not need to pay any money to any official, all you are required\nto do is swear an affidavit at the International Court of Justice\nHague The Netherlands, authorizing the bank to deduct all charges from\nyour principal fund and transfer the balance of funds to your bank\naccount after deduction.\nIf you have spent any money in the past in your quest for\npayment,kindly let me know so that I can follow this up. You can reach\nme on my  email for a directive on how you can get the deduction don\nBarrister. John West. (SAN)\nDirector Of Foreign Debts Settlements Of the International Court of Justice"

        "body": "Hello Barrister John West,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite a surprise to hear about all these happenings. I must admit, it's a bit overwhelming and confusing for me.\n\nYou mentioned that there are some powerful individuals behind this act without due notice to me. Could you please elaborate on who these individuals might be? Also, what kind of problems might I encounter with the Court of Justice?\n\nI'm also curious about the committee set up by the payment committee. What is their role exactly? And how do they verify and scrutinize all debts owed to foreign entities?\n\nIt's disheartening to hear about the corruption within the bank officials. But I'm not sure I understand why they would want my fund to remain trapped in the bank. Could you explain their motive behind this?\n\nLastly, you mentioned swearing an affidavit at the Court of Justice in The Hague. How does this process work? And how will it help in getting the charges deducted from my principal fund?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to your guidance.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
