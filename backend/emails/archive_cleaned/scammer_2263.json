        "body": "Hello Ms. Ruth Daniel,\n\nIt's a pleasure to make your acquaintance! I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it sounds like you've had quite the career at Eris Trust Bank. It's unfortunate to hear about the lack of promotions, especially considering your dedication and years of service.\n\nI'm curious about this non-current account you mentioned. Could you explain more about how it works? And how does the ATM master debit card link to this account?\n\nAlso, I'm interested in knowing more about your plans after retirement. You mentioned wanting to get into retirement with a good investment - do you have any specific plans or ideas?\n\nAs for the details you requested, I'm afraid I can't provide them at this time due to privacy concerns. However, I'd be happy to continue our conversation and learn more about what you're proposing.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S: Unfortunately, I won't be able to call as my phone is currently out of service.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
