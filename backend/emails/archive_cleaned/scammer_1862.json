We, the leader of the world's crime fighters, have teamed up to let the world know what is going on, and we have recovered over $522 million (Five Hundred and Twenty-two Million Dollars) from fraudsters around the world.\r\nDuring the meeting, the United Nations, African Unity and the International Monetary Fund ordered the money recovered from these fraudsters to be shared among the victim of the fraudsters.\r\nThis message was sent to you because our Logistics Department gave us a list of beneficiaries/inheritors to be paid who fall victim to these impostors due to lack of awareness. Your email address was equally found in one of the Scam Artists files and on the computer hard drive during our investigation and you will be compensated with a sum of $6,500,000.00 (Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).\r\nThe mode of payment was well specified for proper conducts and financial regulations to kick against criminality during the process of payment. It was agreed that it will be paid through our accredited online banking or ATM Debit Visa CardÂ \r\n1. Full Name..............................2. Nationality.............................3.
