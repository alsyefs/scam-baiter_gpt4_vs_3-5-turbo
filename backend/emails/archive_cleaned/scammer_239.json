        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope you're having a good weekend as well. I must admit, your message has caught me by surprise since we haven't been in contact before. However, I'm interested to hear what you have to say about my payment and the lottery winnings.\n\nYou mentioned that there have been some issues with my payment due to wrong advice from people claiming to help me. Can you please provide more details about this? Who are these people and what kind of advice did they give?\n\nYou also mentioned a lawsuit against my file at the Federal High Court in Nigeria. That sounds concerning. Could you explain why this lawsuit was filed and who is behind it? It's important for me to understand the situation fully.\n\nRegarding the importance of having a lawyer, I agree that legal representation can be crucial in certain situations. Can you elaborate on how having a lawyer would benefit me in this case? What specific role would they play?\n\nI appreciate your concern and willingness to offer advice. However, before proceeding further, I would like to know more about your background and how you came across this information. It's important for me to verify the credibility of the information being shared.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nRandy"
