They still use your name and payment identification\nnumber as the beneficiary but they have changed the account\nco-ordinate and that is why they are frustrating you by asking for\nmoney every time in order for them to perfect their act.I have the\npayment reference number of the transaction and also I have\ninformation on whom you should report this matter to for immediate\naction and investigation. I do not need any gratification from you\neither in cash or kind, I do this because of my religious belief.\nI can never be a part of evil because the bible says \" YE SHALL KNOW\nTHE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE\" (JOHN 8:32). Please\nrespect my discretion in this matter. You can send an email to me so\nthat I can give you the reference number and the follow up information\non how you should go about this. I repeat, please do not expose my\nperson, it is not easy to get jobs around here and I cannot content\nwith these powerful individuals as they can go to any length for\nrevenge.\nThank you and Remain Blessed.\nRev David Yemi   "

        "body": "Dear Rev David Yemi,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and sharing this information. I appreciate your concern and willingness to help. It's quite alarming to hear about such a conspiracy involving Mr. Paul Abu and Mr. Godwin Emefiele.\n\nI would definitely like to know more about the steps I should take to ensure the safety of my funds. Could you please provide me with the reference number and the necessary follow-up instructions? I want to make sure that I handle this situation correctly.\n\nAlso, I completely understand your need for discretion in this matter. Rest assured, I will keep our conversation confidential. It's unfortunate that finding jobs can be challenging, and I wouldn't want anything negative to happen to you because of your involvement in exposing this conspiracy.\n\nOnce again, thank you for bringing this matter to my attention, Rev David Yemi.
