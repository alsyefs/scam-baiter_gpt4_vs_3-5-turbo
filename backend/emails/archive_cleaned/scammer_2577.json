However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) guaranteeing my payment? How did they become involved in this process?\n\n2. Could you explain how the ATM Master Gold Card works? Is it a prepaid card that will be loaded with my funds, or will it be linked directly to my bank account?\n\n3. What is the purpose of providing a scanned copy of my ID? How will it be used in this process?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed.\n\nBest wishes,\nKam"
