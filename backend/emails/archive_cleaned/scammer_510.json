Kennedy International airport, New York- working hand\nin hand with Department of Homeland Security and U.S Customs and\nBorder Protection. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned\nshipment from a Diplomat from London, UK and when scanned it revealed\nan undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box weighing\napproximately 25kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the\nContent was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it\nwas declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the shipping\nagent and also the Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees.\nOn my assumption, each of the boxes will contain about $3Million to\n$4Million each and the consignment is still left in the storage house\ntill today. The consignment are two metal boxes with weight of about\n25kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective\ncapacity: 110 LBS.). Approximately, the details of the consignment\nincluding your name and address, the official document from United\nNation office in London are tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.\nPROVIDE YOUR NAME, PHONE NUMBER AND FULL HOME ADDRESS, TO CROSS CHECK\nIF IT CORRESPONDS WITH THE NAME AND ADDRESS ON THE CONSIGNMENT\nINCLUDING THE NAME OF NEAREST AIRPORT AROUND YOUR CITY AND OTHER\nDETAILS.\nI want us to transact this business with you and share the money,\nsince the shipper has abandoned it and disappeared. I will pay for the\nNon inspection fee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this\nairport to your address by myself. But I will share it 30%/70% with\nyou. Make sure Respond to me via my direct EMAIL:\n(\ndavidcarlee1932@outlook.com\n)\nDavid C. Lee\nINSPECTION UNIT   "

        "body": "Hello David C. Lee,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this intriguing information with me. I must say, it's not every day that one hears about abandoned shipments containing such a significant amount of money.\n\nI'm curious to know more about how these situations usually unfold. What happens when the consignee doesn't declare the content properly? And what are the usual procedures for handling abandoned shipments at your inspection unit?\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on the Non Inspection Fees? How much do they typically amount to and why is it necessary to pay them?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTaylor"
