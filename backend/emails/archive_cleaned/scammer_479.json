        "body": "Hello David P. Wilson,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I had no idea about these abandoned boxes. It's really strange that someone would just leave them behind like that. \n\nYou mentioned that the boxes contain raw cash in US currency notes, how did you come to find out about this? And why was it declared as personal effects?\n\nAlso, you mentioned some fees like storage clearance and Non-inspection fee. Could you please explain more about these fees? How much are they and why do they need to be paid?\n\nI'm also curious about the secure shipping company agent you mentioned. What kind of security measures do they provide for such deliveries?\n\nAs for your share from the funds, I think it's only fair that you get compensated for your efforts. However, I'd like to know more details before making any decisions.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrandon"
