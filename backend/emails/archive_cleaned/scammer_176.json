It's not every day that one gets a message from the President of Uganda Republic himself!\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned something about shipping, delivery process, and customs clearance fees. Could you please elaborate on what these fees are for? And why is it necessary to pay them before I can start using the ATM card?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about how this fund was merited to me? I'm just curious about how my name came up in this selection process.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
