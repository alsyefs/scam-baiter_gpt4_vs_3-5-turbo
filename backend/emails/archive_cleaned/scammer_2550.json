        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information about UPS Delivering Service and the government's decision to send my funds through UPS Courier Service delivery. It sounds like a convenient option.\n\nI understand that the needful documents for the delivery have been issued in my name, except for the insurance document. Could you please provide more details about why an insurance document is necessary? I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of the process.\n\nAlso, could you explain how the payment for the insurance fee through a gift card or steam wallet card works? Is there a specific amount that needs to be paid? And once I make the payment, how will I receive confirmation that it has been received?\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
