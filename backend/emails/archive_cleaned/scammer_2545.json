I wasn't expecting any kind of payment, so your email has certainly piqued my interest.\n\nRegarding Mr. Stephen, I'm not sure who that might be. Could you provide more details about him? How did he claim to be my next of kin?\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on the process and the fee involved? You mentioned it's refundable if I don't receive the funds as promised - how does that work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMaureen"
