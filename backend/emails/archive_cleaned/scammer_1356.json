I am indeed interested in various business ventures, particularly those related to real estate, agriculture, and technology. However, I am open to other lucrative sectors as well.\n\nAs for the diamond export business, it was a family business that my parents were involved in. They had connections with diamond miners and dealers across Africa and used these connections to buy diamonds at a lower price. Then they would export these diamonds to buyers in Europe and America.\n\nI hope this gives you a better understanding of my background. Please let me know if there are any other questions you have or any other information you need from me.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonald"

The process involved mining the diamonds, getting them cut and polished, then exporting them to various parts of the world where they were sold at premium prices.\n\nI hope this gives you a clearer picture of my previous line of work.

It involved sourcing diamonds from local miners, processing them, and then exporting them to international buyers. The process required a deep understanding of the diamond market, as well as strong connections with both local miners and international buyers.\n\nI hope this gives you a better understanding of my background and interests.
