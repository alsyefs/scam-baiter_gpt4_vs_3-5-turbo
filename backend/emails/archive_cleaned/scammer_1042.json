I must say, this is quite unexpected as I wasn't aware of any pending transactions or unclaimed funds in my name.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this? For instance, how did these funds come to be associated with my account? Also, could you clarify what the required fee is for?\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nPauline"
