It's reassuring to know that there won't be any fees charged upfront.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about the process of confirming my payment in my account? How long does it usually take for the counter affidavit to be obtained and sent to me?\n\nAlso, I would like to know if there are any specific documents or information that I need to provide in order to proceed with this process smoothly.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nAngela"
