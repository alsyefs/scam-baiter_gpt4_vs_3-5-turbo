        "body": "Hello Mrs. Shelly Weiss,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it's not every day that one receives such news. \n\nI'm curious about a few things though. How did the United Nations and the World Bank Group come to select me as one of the victims? Also, could you please explain more about this process? How does it work exactly?\n\nI'm also interested in knowing more about your role as the Former Director Library Museum Online. That sounds like an interesting position.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRita"
