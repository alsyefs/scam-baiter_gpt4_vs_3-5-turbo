        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected message. It's not every day that one receives a communication from the Federal Ministry of Finance of Nigeria.\n\nI'm curious about the details of this arrangement. Could you please elaborate on how exactly this ATM Master Card system works? And why was my email ID deleted from the central computer?\n\nAlso, I'm surprised to hear about the news of my supposed demise! That's certainly news to me. How did this misunderstanding occur?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAngie"
