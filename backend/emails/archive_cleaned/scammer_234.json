Adanson Hilbert,\r\n\r\nThank you for your detailed explanation. It's quite an interesting\r\nsituation, isn't it? I must admit, I'm not very familiar with these kinds\r\nof matters, but I'm eager to learn more.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned that the money is currently in a Security Company. Could you\r\ntell me more about this company? How does it work and what kind of security\r\nmeasures do they have in place?\r\n\r\nAlso, you said that we will need to process some documents on my name as\r\nthe next of kin. What kind of documents are these exactly? And how long\r\ndoes this process usually take?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but as I said before, this is all new to\r\nme and I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\nBest wishes,\r\nAmy"
