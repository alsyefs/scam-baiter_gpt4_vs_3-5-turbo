Due to the ongoing controversial election and new currency policy by the Central Bank of Nigeria (which mainly is targeted against politicians), my client had requested me to solicit confidential collaboration with an honest individual with the capacity to receive a huge sum of money for Investment at his discretion. The funds in question are proceeds from \"Turn Around Maintenance'' Contract of an aging refinery/Privatization of a redundant Steel company, Dock Yard and Concession of a Sea-Port Terminal as well as 200,000 Megawatts Independent Power plant.\nMore details shall be provided immediately you respond.\nYou have my highest regard\nJohn Jon Sunk\nChief Operating Officer   "
