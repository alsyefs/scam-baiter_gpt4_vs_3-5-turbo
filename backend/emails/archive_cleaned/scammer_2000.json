It's really kind of the United Nation IMF to provide financial support during these challenging times.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about this donation relief fund? How was I selected for this? And could you also clarify what information would be needed from me to proceed with any of these payment methods?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarcos"
