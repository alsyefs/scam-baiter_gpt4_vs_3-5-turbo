        "body": "Hello Mr. Albert Jide Duru,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my overdue funds. I appreciate your concern about bad officials and impostors who may try to deceive me. It's good to know that the Cyber Crime Division of the FBI, British Interpol, and the African Truth and Commission are working together to address these issues.\n\nI would like to proceed with receiving my payment. Could you please provide more information about the two methods of payment you mentioned? How does the check method work, and what are the steps involved? Similarly, how does the ATM card method work, and what should I expect if I choose that option?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what documents will be provided to give legal backup to my funds? It's important for me to understand the process and ensure everything is legitimate.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
