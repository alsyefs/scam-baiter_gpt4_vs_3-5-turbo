However, before I proceed, I have a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1. Could you please provide more details about the financial affiliate who ordered the transfer? How are they affiliated with your organization?\n\n2. Can you explain what an Escrow Account is and how it works? I want to make sure I understand the process fully.\n\n3. Is there any specific reason why the funds are being transferred through Banco Progreso Madrid Spain? Are there any fees or charges associated with this transfer?\n\n4. What is the purpose of retrieving the funds to the treasury after ten business days? Is there any particular requirement or regulation that necessitates this step?\n\nI look forward to receiving your response and clarifications on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nAshley"
