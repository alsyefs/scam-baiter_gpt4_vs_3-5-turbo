I am (Mrs) Judith Oduluso,the office assistant to the Central Bank Governor .I am not telling you this to impress you or to gain any favor from you, rather I am doing this to save you from further damage and pains.I have done this to two people already, though they betrayed me at the end.\nBefore I proceed,you must promise me that nobody will know of this and after you are satisfied with my job,you can help me in whatever way the spirit of God directs you.\n \nThis is very secret,I overheard the governor and other bank executives here in Nigeria saying that they will make sure you spend and pay much fees till you are tired and abandoned your UN/ World Bank Approved compensation amount of $10,000,000.00 (Ten million United States Dollars) for them to later divert to an already opened offshore account in USA. Please do not pay anything to anyone again regarding the release of your fund(ATM CARD) because none of these evil perpetrators have your interest at heart. The President of Nigeria and the members of his Federal Executive Council have since endorsed the payment of this approved compensation fund to you and your account is already activated which you can access at any time and your ATM card programmed and ready to dispatch to you. It is just that some of our bank executives are very greedy and they have created avenues to steal your money even when they know that the situation is very critical. I and another Christian colleague in the office have to help you out.\n \nNow, we have perfectly pulled out the ATM card that contains your UN/ World Bank Compensation payment amount . We are ready to send it to you immediately, PLEASE, our job is on the line. I am only 34 years married with two kids (A Boy and A Girl) and I don't want to ruin my future or die at this early age. I do not make calls on transactions like this due to the sensitive nature of this transaction and my position with the CBN. I will not deliver this ATM card to you if you let anyone know of this.\n \nIf this arrangement is OK with you please reply now and we will send the ATM card to you through DHL and all these horrendous and callous treatment will stop and you will happily receive your fund to your designated home address.\nIn addition, all the documents pertaining to the compensation are intact with us showing that it is not Drug Money or meant to sponsor Terrorist attack in your Country.\n \nGet back to me if you are interested so that we can proceed.\n \nRegards.\n \nMrs Judith Oduluso.\nOffice assistant to the Central Bank Governor.

        "body": "Dear Mrs. Judith Oduluso,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must admit, it is quite alarming to hear about the greed and corruption within the Central Bank of Nigeria. I appreciate your concern for my well-being and for wanting to save me from further damage.\n\nI understand that you have already helped two people in a similar situation, although they ended up betraying you. That must have been disheartening for you. Rest assured, I am not here to take advantage of your kindness or betray your trust.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about how exactly I can access my UN World Bank Approved amount? You mentioned that my account is already activated and that the ATM card is ready to be dispatched. How long does it usually take for the card to arrive via DHL?\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what documents are included with the ATM card? It's important for me to understand the legitimacy of this transaction and ensure that everything is in order.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance, Mrs. Judith Oduluso. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLisa"
