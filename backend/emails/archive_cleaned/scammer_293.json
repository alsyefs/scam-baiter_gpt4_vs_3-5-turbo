        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm thrilled to hear about the progress of my transfer payment. However, I have a few questions that I hope you can help clarify.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why my personal presence is required for signing the payment release order? Is it not possible to do this electronically or via mail?\n\nSecondly, regarding the attorney, how would this process work? Would I need to find an attorney myself or would one be provided? Also, what would be the estimated legal fee for this service?\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about these payment documents that need to be signed? What exactly are they and what information do they contain?\n\nI look forward to your response. Thank you in advance for your assistance.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRosemary"
