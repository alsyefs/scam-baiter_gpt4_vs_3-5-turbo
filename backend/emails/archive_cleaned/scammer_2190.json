        "body": "Hello Rev Poole Benjamin,\n\nThank you for your message. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about my own death! I can assure you that I am very much alive and well. As for William Huges and John Camel, I don't recall knowing anyone by those names. \n\nI'm curious though, how did these gentlemen come to know about this fund? And why would they think it belongs to them? Also, could you please explain more about this fund? How did it come into existence and why is it under my name?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nP.S: For security reasons, I prefer not to share personal information like phone numbers, addresses or ID cards over email.\n\nBest wishes,\nKristina"
