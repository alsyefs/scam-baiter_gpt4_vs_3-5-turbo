And I have therefore discovered that a new bank account has been submitted to divert your payment to a German bank as stated below:\nFRANKFURTER BANK\nA/C NO.: 367840545\nSWIFT CODE: 50050201\nBENEFICIARY: CERSTIN WENGER.\nThe new account was submitted with a letter stating that you have died, and have directed the new beneficiary to claim your fund. You are therefore required to urgently confirm if this development is true and has your authority. All arrangements to effect payment to the new bank account have been completed, but is kept pending until we hear from you.\nRespond immediately with your full details, so that all perceived anomalies will be corrected, to ensure that we do not release your fund to the wrong persons.\nSincerely,\nVictor Jonathan\nManager\nBanking & Payment System\n(Foreign Remittance Department)\nCentral Bank of Nigeria.
