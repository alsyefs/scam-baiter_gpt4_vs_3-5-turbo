        "body": "   Hello , Thank you for your email. I know my reply might have come too late. But the situation still remains the same. A day after I sent you this message, we headed out to Mariupol to deliver  humanitarian aid. Unfortunately we were hit by russian artillery and many of our staff lost their lives,  I was badly wounded and I spent 7 months in the ICU.  When I regained consciousness, I couldn't find my phone. I lost everything. But with time I have been able to retrieve and recover my email password. I just logged in now and I saw your message. Thank you for wanting to help. We are still delivering humanitarian aid, the situation has gotten worse than it was when the war started. Ukraine is losing ground due to lack of sufficient ammunition supply from the west. And many people from the west have  moved on from the WAR. But in Ukraine people are dying daily, especially at the frontline villages.\nIf you still want to help please kindly reach out to me. Nothing is too small at this point. \nThank you and stay blessed.\nAndre   "

Can you tell me more about why food, water, and warm clothes are considered the most essential? Also, is there a specific type of food that is more beneficial in such situations?\n\nBest wishes,\nCalvin"
