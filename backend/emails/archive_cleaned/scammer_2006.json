I never thought I'd be involved in something as big as a lottery win. \n\nI'm curious about a few things though. How was my email address selected for this lottery? And why was the payment initially declined? Also, could you please explain more about the ATM Visa Card and how it works?\n\nI appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSanford"
