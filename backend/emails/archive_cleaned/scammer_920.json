        "body": "Hello Mr. Georges Elhedery,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I'm not sure how Mrs. Cynthia Edward got the idea that I was no longer among the living, but I can assure you that I am very much alive and well.\n\nI don't recall ever giving Mrs. Edward any authority to claim anything on my behalf. Could you please provide more information about her? How did she come to be in contact with your bank?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about this fund? How did it come to be approved by the United States Government and why has it been assigned to me?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPablo"
