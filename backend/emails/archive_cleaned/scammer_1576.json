        "body": "Hello Soda,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it sounds like an exciting opportunity. However, I have a few questions that I hope you can help clarify.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain more about the nature of these funds? What exactly is this payment for? \n\nSecondly, why do I need to travel to South Africa and Europe? Is there no way to handle this process remotely?\n\nLastly, you mentioned that I won't be spending any money in this project. Does that mean all expenses including accommodation and meals during my travels will be covered by your government?\n\nI'm sorry if my questions seem naive. As you can imagine, this is all very new to me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDean"
