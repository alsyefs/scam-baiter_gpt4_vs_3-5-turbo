It's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain why the World Bank of UK has chosen me for this? Also, could you provide more details about how the ATM Visa Card works? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSandra"
