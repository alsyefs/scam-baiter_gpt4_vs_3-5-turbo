        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the delivery of my ATM CARD parcel. I appreciate the update on your successful arrival at the airport. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with any payments.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide me with more information about the Express Delivery Company that instructed you to deliver the parcel? I would like to know more about their reputation and track record.\n\nSecondly, I understand that there are legal back up papers required by the Airport Authority. Could you explain in more detail what these papers are and why they are necessary? It's important for me to have a clear understanding of all the procedures involved.\n\nLastly, I would like to confirm the authenticity of this transaction. Is there any way for me to verify your identity as a Diplomatic Agent? Perhaps you could provide me with some form of official identification or documentation?\n\nI look forward to your response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nCaprice"
