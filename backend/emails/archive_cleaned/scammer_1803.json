        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this urgent attention. I appreciate your prompt response. However, before proceeding further, I have a few questions regarding the release of my funds.\n\n1. Could you please provide me with more information about the insurance company that has instructed you to release the funds? I would like to verify their credibility and ensure that this is a legitimate transaction.\n\n2. What is the reason behind the release of these funds? Is there any specific policy or claim that I need to be aware of?\n\n3. Can you explain the process involved in releasing the funds? Are there any fees or charges associated with it? If so, what are they for?\n\n4. Is there a specific timeline within which I need to provide my bank account details and home address? I want to make sure that everything is done securely and efficiently.\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on these matters. Thank you.\n\nBest wishes,\nRickey"
