However, I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message.\n\nCould you please clarify what exactly is the total amount that is supposed to be transferred? Also, could you explain more about the process of picking up the money from a Western Union facility? \n\nYou mentioned something about an extension number as well. Could you please elaborate on what that is and why it's needed?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nNan"
