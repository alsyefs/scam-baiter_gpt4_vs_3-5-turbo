I wonder why you haven't noticed all this while.\nYour fund was authorized to be paid to you through the WB/IMF financial consultants in the USA with a Key Tested Reference/CLAIMS CODE Number,which was supposed to have been issued to you before now, Upon your response to this message, I shall give you all you need to contact the World Bank payment centers in the USA to facilitate the release of your payment.\nYours truly,\nMs.Jessica T. Sanson\nEmail: \njessisanson110@proton.me\n "
