        "body": "Hello Mr. Wray,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the Criminal Justice Services Division. I appreciate you taking the time to explain why you are contacting me. It's interesting to hear about these emails claiming to have funds coming my way.\n\nI must admit, I've received a few similar emails in the past, so it's good to know that you're advising me to be cautious. Could you please provide more details about why these people are considered fraud? What kind of scams are they running?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about how my funds have increased to a million USD. That sounds quite substantial! Can you explain why there was a delay in getting the funds to me in the first place?\n\nBefore we proceed further, could you clarify your role and responsibilities within the Criminal Justice Services Division? It would help me understand better why you are involved in this matter.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSharon"
