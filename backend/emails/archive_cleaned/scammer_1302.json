        "body": "Hello Barrister Ken Morris,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope you're doing well too. Happy New Year to you as well!\n\nI appreciate you informing me about the funds belonging to Monica Daniels Tkachenkov. It sounds like an interesting opportunity. However, before I provide my address, could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\n1. How did Monica Daniels Tkachenkov come across such a large sum of money?\n2. Why is it necessary to send the funds through a sealed box instead of using traditional banking methods?\n3. Can you explain more about the role of your diplomat agent? How does this delivery process work?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of these details, I'll be able to proceed accordingly.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
