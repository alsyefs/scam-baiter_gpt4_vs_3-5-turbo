That you are DEAD since 2019 and therefore your Allocation will be used for another beneficiary that is still alive. So i don't know how true this story is, that is why i decided to send you this mail then if i did not get any response from you i will give them the go ahead order to remove your name on the loaded ATM CARD. Without wasting time I advise you to get back to me if you are alive. Thanks.\nFaithfully Yours\nCHRISTOPHER A WRAY\n \nFederal Bureau of Investigation\nJ.
