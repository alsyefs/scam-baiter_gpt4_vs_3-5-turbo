        "body": "Hello Mr. Richard Silver,\n\nThank you for your prompt response and the detailed information about my Box Fund. It's quite interesting to know that there are many packages at the storage. I can only imagine how busy it must be at the airport!\n\nI'm curious, why was my Box Fund abandoned due to content and lack of clearance? Also, could you please explain a bit more about the process of evacuating the packages?\n\nAs for picking up the box, I think I would prefer it to be delivered via courier service as it would be more convenient for me. Could you provide me with more details about each courier service option? Like their delivery time frames, any additional services they offer etc.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nScott"
