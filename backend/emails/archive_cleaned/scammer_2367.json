        "body": "Hello Hamza,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. I must admit, it's a bit confusing. Could you please elaborate on what exactly should have been concluded by now? And what is this long overdue payment you're referring to?\n\nI'm also curious about the foundation that was never perfected. Could you provide more details about that? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
