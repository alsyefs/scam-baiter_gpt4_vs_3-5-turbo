        "body": "I am Mr. Jose Peterson, a merchant in the Middle East. But based in London uk I have been diagnosed with Cancer which was discovered very late, due to my\nlaxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine,Right\nnow I have only about a few months to live, according to my Medical Doctor.\nI have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for\nmyself but the oil business. Though, I am very rich, I was never ge!\nnervous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.\nBut now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than\njust wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God\ngives me a second chance and heal me I would live my life a different way\nfrom how I have lived it.I have sowed a seed for my healing I have willed\nand given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended\nfamily members and as well as a few close friends. I want God to be\nmerciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to\ncharity organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of\nthe Tsunami Victims and the Hurricane Katrina in USA, as I want this to be\none of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money\nto some charity organizations in India and Malaysia. Now that my health has\ndeteriorated so badly, I cannot do this mays! Elf anymore.\nI once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank\nand distribute the money which I have there to charity organization and to\nthe less privileged in Bulgaria and Sudan-Africa They cashed the money but\nkept it only to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem\nnot to be contended with what I have left for them already. The last of my\nmoney which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $4,million that\nI have in the BANK for safe keeping. I want you to\ncollect this deposit on my behalf and disburse half of it to the Hurricane\nKatrina in USA as well as Tsunami Earthquake victims in Asia for the less\nprivileged (for charity purpose) and the other half to set up an investment\nthat is profit base in other to keep the charity work alive.\nPlease send me a mail to indicate your wiliness to assist in this\ndisbursement. For your willingness and readiness to act accord! dangly, I\nwill set aside 40% for you for your time and efforts in caring out this\nresponsibility on my behalf while, the remaining 60% will be used by you for\nboth charity work and setting up of an investment that is profit oriented\nto enable you continue to assist the less privileged from time to time from\nthe profit you make from this investment annually. I need your urgent reply\nso that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle\nthis project. I look forward to hear from you soon.\nGod bless you."
