It's hard to even imagine what one could do with such a sum.\n\nI'm curious though, how did I come to be the lucky recipient of this prize? Could you please provide more details about this Coca Cola winning? \n\nAlso, I'm not quite clear on why there is a fee involved. Could you explain that part to me as well?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nEllen"
