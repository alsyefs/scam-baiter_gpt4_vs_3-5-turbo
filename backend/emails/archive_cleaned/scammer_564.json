        "body": "Hello Mr. Sanchez Moore,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite surprising to hear about the abandoned fund and the approved palliative measure funds from IMF AND WORLD BANK. I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what all of this means.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about these funds? How did they come to be abandoned and why have they been approved for me? Also, could you clarify what you mean by \"palliative measure funds\"?\n\nI'm also curious about Mr. Erick Schmitz of Deutsche Bank, Zurich Account Auditing department officer. What is his role in all of this?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nPedro"
