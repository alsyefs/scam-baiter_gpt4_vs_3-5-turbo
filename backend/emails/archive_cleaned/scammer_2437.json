        "body": "Hello Mr. Stephen Bakken,\n\nThank you for your message and the information provided. It's great to hear that everything has been completed and my inherited funds have been converted and credited to an ATM VISA CARD.\n\nI appreciate your help in paying the fee for the delivery of the ATM VISA CARD. I understand that you expect me to pay you back once I receive it, which seems fair.\n\nHowever, before we proceed further, could you please provide more details about this process? For instance, how did my funds end up in an ATM Visa Card? Also, could you explain why there are keeping fees involved and why they increase over time?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMaria"
