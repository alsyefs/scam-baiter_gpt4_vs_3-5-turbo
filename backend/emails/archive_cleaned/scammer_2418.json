I'm really excited about this opportunity and can't wait to get started.\n\nHowever, I must apologize as I am not comfortable sharing my full name and address over email due to privacy concerns. Is there any other way we could proceed without me having to provide such personal information?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRachel"
