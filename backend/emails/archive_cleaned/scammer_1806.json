        "body": "Hello Mrs. Linda Solomon,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the abandoned parcel containing an ATM card. I appreciate your efforts in trying to locate the rightful owner. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the ATM card? Is it linked to a specific bank or financial institution? Also, how did you come across my name and email address as the recipient of this parcel?\n\nAdditionally, I'm curious about the mailing fee you mentioned. Could you please explain why there is a fee involved and how it should be paid? Is there any way to verify the legitimacy of this transaction?\n\nThank you for your assistance in clarifying these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nMaria"
