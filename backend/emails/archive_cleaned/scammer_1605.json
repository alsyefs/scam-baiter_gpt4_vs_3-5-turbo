The location will not be an issue, I can be anywhere in the world provided it is serving the purpose of orphanage and charity.\r\n\r\nHe also had the plan of sponsoring the expansion of the message of Jesus Christ to the people who has not received the good news especially in some countries of the world where Christians are persecuted like in the Middle East, Far East, and some parts of Africa etc. It will be your work to look for people working in these areas and encourage them.\r\nThese projects will be 100% Non-governmental organization (NGO) and also Non Profitable.  If there is any don given when the home starts operation it will be used to pay the staffs the rest will be put into the same project for smooth running and enlargement.My family will stand to gain nothing from the projects, It will be dedicated to God allmighty.\r\nFirst, I want you to draw a sketch on how you will utilise the funds if it is made available to you, our purpose is Charity home and expansion of the word of God through Charity, Tell me about location, logistics etc.\r\n\r\nThe orphanage home can be located anywhere in the world provided it is running smoothly and we can start the sponsoring of the preaching of the word of God from anywhere as well.\r\n\r\nI will be waiting for your mail on how to proceed.

I'm truly honored to be part of such a noble cause.\n\nRegarding the property, it sounds like a wonderful vision. A peaceful, spacious place away from the city noise would indeed be ideal for learning and growth. I can start researching suitable properties or lands that meet these criteria.\n\nHowever, as I am not a real estate expert, it might be beneficial to involve a professional realtor who could provide us with accurate cost estimates and ensure we find the best possible location for this project.\n\nAs for the legal aspects, it's great to hear that your family attorney will handle most of them. If there's any need for an attorney here, we can certainly arrange that too.\n\nI understand that my contact information might be needed by your bank and attorney. However, due to privacy concerns, I would prefer not to share my personal details over email. Is there another secure way we could handle this?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPenny"

Why are you asking me questions on the things I have explained to you?  Questions such as?   ’’ What kind of project is it and what does it involve?\r\nAlso, regarding the budget, could you clarify how much has been set aside for this project? It would be helpful to know so we can plan accordingly, I'm curious to know more about the project you mentioned. Could you provide some additional details? What kind of features or amenities are you hoping to include in this home?’’.\r\n\r\nYou have answers to these questions so why repeat them again?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI told you that there will be two dormitories for boys and girls, the dormitories have to be separated very close to the refectory and far from the classrooms, other things include, refectory, clinic, lawn or field for sports, a Chapel for prayers and classrooms for learning, staff office etc. It has to be a fenced environment with two gates (Main Gate and small exit Gate for pedestrians). The home has to be well furnished with leaning equipment’s, furniture’s like beds, cupboards, chairs. There will be staff bus and service cars etc.\r\n\r\n It has to be a suitable environment. I am not an expert in designs, we shall engage the services of an architect to design the compound according to the land we shall get. With these brief explanations an architect will know what to design for us.\r\n\r\nI hope to meet the attorney today and I hope after our discussions he will apply to the bank on my behalf for the transfer of the project sum ( this is part of the discussions I will have with him). I will link you with him to tell you what bank will need from you as my partner in this project and as the person who will receive the money meant for this project.\r\n\r\nHope to have explained very well to you now. I am waiting for the result of your own enquiry’s.\r\n\r\nHave a very good beginning of the week.\nThanks,\r\n\r\nMrs. Maureen A. Greaves\r\n\r\n(Church Army evangelist)"

        "body": "Dear Penny,I thank God for another breaking of the day. I want you to know that theidea of this orphanage home was the project my late husband was nursing in hisheart before his sudden death, he informed me about it but I was not planningit with him, now that he is no more, I want to fulfil that project in honour ofhis memory.\r\n You are asking me questions as if I am an expert in establishingorphanages. I am not and have never worked in an orphanage in my life. What Iknow is that we can get what ever we want with the aid of people who hasmanaged orphanage in their life, there are orphanage home in the U K bothgovernment owned and private, we can demand the contacts of their retired andold staffs that can put us through. Yes, it will cost us money but we shall getwhat we want, we can even sign contract with them provided we get what we wantfrom them.\r\nWe cannot talk about roles and salary scale now because nothing has beenestablished. \r\nMy general assessment of our family attorney is that he is a good man,if not he will not be representing my family for such a long time even when mylate husband was alive, he never makes any bad remark on him. We bought manyproperties here through his representation even the house where I am living nowwas bought through him.\r\n I cannot give breakdown of any budget now because we don’t know how muchland costs, we don’t have any building plan and how much it will cost, we are just discussing so it istoo early to allocate fund to any project now when you don’t have the estimateof what it will cost.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nYour priority this time should be how to work with the attorney to transferthis fund to U K where you will have money to start making your enquiries andnot asking question upon questions.\r\n You shold move on and start acting from now. Contact the attorney today, tell him that I directedyou to contact him, let him tell you about the USD$15.5 Million that I want totransfer to U K for an orphanage home building. Don’t fail to do this today, Ihave already informed him that my partner in the U K will contact him.Have a nice day.Maureen Greaves.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your detailed response.

They will also train our staff in managing the facility effectively. The skills they will impart include basic childcare, administrative duties, and emergency procedures among others. As for their payment, I can't provide an exact figure now as it would depend on their experience and qualifications.\n\nAbout my family attorney, he has been with us for many years. He is a seasoned professional who has helped us in various legal matters including property acquisition. He is trustworthy and efficient.\n\nAs for the budget allocation of USD 5 Million, it's too early to give a detailed breakdown as we are still in the planning phase. However, rest assured that every penny will be used judiciously towards building a safe haven for orphans.\n\nI hope this answers your questions.

I'm just curious, could you please explain a bit more about how this transfer process works? And what kind of work does your family attorney do to ensure the fund reaches its destination safely? \n\nI'm sorry if I ask too many questions, I just want to understand everything clearly. Thank you for your patience!\n\nBest wishes,\nPenny"
