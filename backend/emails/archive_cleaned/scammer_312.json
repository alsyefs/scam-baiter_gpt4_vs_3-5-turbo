        "body": "Dear Mr Kenneth,\r\n\r\nI write to solicit your help in getting back the money left in our bank by a deceased customer who I believe was from your country according to our bank records. The late depositor lived and worked in the Philippines and he deposited the sum of sixteen million, four thousand US dollars (US$16,004,000.00) in our bank as fixed deposit in early 2005. However, there is a new financial law in our country that prohibits foreigners without a Labor Permit (Work Permit) to open a new bank account or operate an existing bank account. In regard to this new law, we have advised all our foreign customers who opened their bank account without a labor permit to either bring their labor permit to have their bank account updated or have their deposits withdrawn from our bank. Failure to update such a bank account with a labor permit will mean losing the deposit to the government of our country if the deposit is not withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAs the operations manager of my bank branch, I have tried several times to alert this particular depositor on the new law and why his bank account must be immediately updated with a labor permit or have his deposit withdrawn but he could not be reached. The deposit will soon be taken over by the government since I could not contact him and he did not leave any other person in the form of a next of kin/beneficiary who I can contact in a case like this. The fear of having the deposit lost to the government of our country prompted me to make inquiries to know his whereabouts and I realized that he died in late 2007 as a result of heart related illness. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating any of his relatives, I seek your consent to present you to our bank as the legal beneficiary to enable you to claim the money he left in our bank.\r\n\r\nBoth of us will share the money into two equal parts when the money is claimed. Everything regarding this claim will be done successfully as I am in a position to influence things in our favor, have no fear about this transaction because it will be perfectly and successfully done. Right now, I have all the copies of documents relating to the deposit and the depositor which you will file to back up your claim as the legal beneficiary of the deposit. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us to claim the deposit successfully and we have to do this within the shortest time possible in order to avert its forfeiture. If you are willing to do this with me, you are to provide me with the below details:\r\n\r\nFull Names:\r\nResidential/Official Address (Not P. O. Box):\r\nCity:\r\nState/Province:\r\nZip/Postal Code:\r\nCountry:\r\nMobile/Cell Phone Number:\r\nAge:\r\nOccupation:\r\nAny Government Identification Card(ID Card)\r\n\r\nOnce I receive the above details which is a confirmation of your willingness to do this with me, I will inform you on what to do next in order to claim the money from our bank. Please this is really a very serious transaction and I want you to take it seriously too and also do not fail to keep it confidential. Thank you.\r\n\nYours sincerely,\r\nRommel Bautista.\r\n(Manila, Philippines)"
