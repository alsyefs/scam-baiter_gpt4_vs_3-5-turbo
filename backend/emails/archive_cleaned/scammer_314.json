        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from Santander Consumer Bank in the United States. I received your previous email and I appreciate you following up with me.\n\nI must say, this sounds quite interesting. So, the government of Benin Republic has alerted your bank about a sum of USD that they want to issue to me through an ATM visa card? That's quite unexpected! Can you please provide more details about how this came about and why I am being chosen for this winning award?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what fees are required for the activation of the ATM card? I want to make sure I have all the necessary information before proceeding.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKenyatta"
