I am a member of the European Debt Recovery Unit and I am aware of your ordeal about your unpaid fund.\nIt may interest you to know that not long after the Debt Management Office (DMO) completed the merger and acquisition process of all pending payments occasion through the petition raised by the international community about their unpaid funds. I discovered that their boss connived with some top officials to divert funds approve to settle unpaid inheritances, email lottery winners, Internet scam victims, unclaimed consignments(concealed funds) and International Contractors.\nThe DMO has already given approval for the payment of your fund but they deliberately withheld your payment file and continue to demand fees from you through their associates from different unassigned affiliates mostly from Africa, US and the Netherlands all in an attempt to frustrate you and enrich themselves. I wonder why you havenâ€™t notice all this while.\nYou may choose to disbelieve this email as inconceivable but my doctrine does not permit such act, reason I have to open up to you to seek the right channel. Your fund was authorize to be paid to you through the DMO asset management firm with a Claim Code Numbers, which was supposed to have been issued to you before now.\nUpon your response, I shall guide you through and provide you with details to contact the assigned affiliate who will expeditiously facilitate the release of your fund.              \nI am now waiting for your urgent response.\nYours faithfully,\nAxel van Trotsenburg\nDirector of Operations\nWorld Bank Washington DC, New York.

        "body": "Hello Axel van,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my unpaid fund. I appreciate your concern and willingness to help. I must admit, I have been quite frustrated with the whole situation, so any guidance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.\n\nCould you please explain to me in more detail how the Debt Management Office (DMO) and their associates are involved in this process? It's a bit confusing for me to understand why they would withhold my payment file and demand fees from me. Is there a specific reason behind their actions?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that the DMO has already given approval for the payment of my fund. Does that mean the funds are currently available and ready to be released? If so, what steps do I need to take in order to ensure a smooth and successful transaction?\n\nI look forward to your response and thank you once again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
