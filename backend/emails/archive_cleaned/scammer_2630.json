It's quite alarming to hear that there are scammers trying to deceive me. I will definitely take your advice seriously and stop communicating with them.\n\nCould you please provide more details about how my phone and email were compromised? I want to make sure I understand the situation fully. Also, if my funds are in your custody, how can I be assured of their safe delivery through DHL?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nConnie"
