        "body": "Hello Johnson,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. It's quite surprising to hear about the sum of US Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars being associated with my name. I must say, it's a bit overwhelming.\n\nI'm curious though, how did this situation come about? How did these banks end up owing me such a large amount? And why was it decided to lodge the funds in an Escrow account under my name?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the modalities that have been put in place for the fund release? I'd like to understand the process better before proceeding further.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
