It's interesting to hear about the Court of Appeals meeting and the decision to bring down the fee as a new year bonus.\n\nI have a few questions if you don't mind. Could you please provide more details about the Tax Clearance that needs to be obtained? What exactly is it for and how does it relate to receiving my fund? Also, could you clarify why Bitcoin btc or Apple Card Steam Wallet Card are the only accepted forms of payment?\n\nI want to make sure I understand everything correctly before proceeding. Thank you again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nTommie"
