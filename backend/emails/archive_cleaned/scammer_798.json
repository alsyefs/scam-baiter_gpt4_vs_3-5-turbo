        "body": "  Attn: Beneficiary.\nWe write in regards to your delayed Contract/Inheritance Funds in the sum of Eight Million Five Hundred thousand United States Dollars (US$8,000,500.00) which you are yet to receive as a result of your inability to raise the required fee(s) to conclude your Transaction.\nThe United Nations has decided to proffer a solution that will make it easier for all the Beneficiaries to receive their Funds. We understood that some Fees are required in order process and Transfer your Funds into your Account. We are also aware that most Beneficiaries do not have these required fees.\n \nWe have therefore deliberated with the Bank in charge of this payment to allow Beneficiaries the privilege of receiving their Funds in two (2) or three (3) installments. In this case, Beneficiaries will no longer be required to pay the fee at once but part of it depending on the number of installments such Beneficiary will like his/her Funds to be released to him/her.\n \nWrite the Bank and request that you want your fund to be transferred to your account by installments payment,(ATM & Wire transfer) so that once the first payments enters into your account you can then use money from there to facilitate the transfer of the remaining balance, once the first installments enters into your account withdrawal from your account to Wells Fargo Bank  Miami, Florida USA.Online transfer procedure.\n \nThe Wells Fargo Bank Miami, Florida USA in which is now in charge of your Payment has agreed to give the Beneficiaries the option of receiving their Funds at once, in two or three installments. Therefore, you should send him your full Name and telephone number/your correct mailing address.\n \nThis will help the beneficiaries to pay part of the fee and receive part of their Funds with which such beneficiary can upset the remaining fee and receive his/her complete Funds.\nTo break this down:\n \nTwo Hundred Dollars ($200) fee will facilitate the release of One Million United States Dollars (US$1,000,000.00) only.Three Hundred Dollars ($300) fee will facilitate the release of Two Million United States Dollars (US$2,000,000.00) only.\n \nFive Hundred  Dollars ($500) fee which is the total fee will facilitate the release of your Full Contract/inheritance Funds in the sum of Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$8,500,000.00).\nWhat a shame and embarrassment? If actually, you have spent money to execute this contract and have spent money in the hands of the fraudsters and impostors without achieving your goal in receiving this fund, what stops you from giving out one chance benefit of doubt and sacrifice with this token fee to see your fund payment successfully completed?\nHowever, Feel free to inform us how much you can raise should you cannot afford any of the above Mentioned installment so as for us to talk to the Bank to know how much out of your Funds they could release to you with the amount you can come up with.\n \nThis is the best the United Nations can do for you and you are advised to take advantage of this opportunity. Kindly, Get back to me immediately with your option so that i will forward you the contact person at the paying Bank in Wells Fargo Bank in Miami, Florida USA. to indicate your preferred option.\nContact Person: Mr. Atinidora O.

        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. It's quite a surprise to hear about this delayed contract fund. I must admit, I'm not entirely sure how I ended up with this sum of money in my name.\n\nCould you please explain more about the origin of these funds? How did they end up being associated with me? Also, could you provide more details about the process of transferring these funds into my account?\n\nI'm also curious about the fees involved. You mentioned several options depending on how much one can afford. Could you clarify how these fees are calculated and why they are necessary?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about your role in this process? Are you affiliated with the United Nations or Wells Fargo Bank?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
