        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from Charles Schwab Bank. I appreciate the information you have provided about your services and the opportunity to receive a new ATM Visa card. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you please explain in more detail how this process works? How will the funds be transferred to the ATM Visa card?\n\n2. Is there a specific reason why I need to provide a copy of my ID card or driving license? How will this information be used?\n\n3. Could you please provide more information about the Worldwide Courier Company that will be handling the delivery of the ATM card? How can I ensure that it is a reliable and secure service?\n\n4. I noticed that there are fees associated with the delivery of the ATM card, such as insurance fees and custom paper clearance documents fees. Are these fees mandatory? Can they be deducted from the funds on the ATM card instead?\n\nI look forward to your response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
