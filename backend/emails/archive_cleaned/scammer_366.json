It's great to hear that everything is ready for the release of my fund.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some details in your message. Could you please clarify what you mean by \"ECOLOGICAL ORDER TO THE COMMUNITY\"? Also, could you provide more information on how this process works?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarc"
