It's not every day that one receives a message from the desk of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nI'm curious about this ATM card you mentioned. How does it work exactly? And why was my fund delayed in the first place?\n\nAlso, could you please clarify what you mean by \"the only money you are obliged to pay is dollars\"? How many dollars are we talking about here?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSylvia"
