        "body": "Hello Mr. Desmond Connor,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite a surprise to hear about these payments left in your custody, including mine. I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what this is all about.\n\nCould you please provide more details? For instance, how did my payment end up in your custody? And why was there a bill of sum imposed on me?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the special BONUS your Head Office is offering entails? Is it related to the fee that needs to be paid?\n\nI noticed some parts of your message are missing some information like the amount and MTCN for tracking the first payment sent this morning. Could you kindly provide these details?\n\nLastly, I'm curious about this new project you mentioned that will start after two days. What kind of project is it?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKeri"
