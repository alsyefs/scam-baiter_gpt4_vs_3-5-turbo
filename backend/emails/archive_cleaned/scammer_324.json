        "body": "Hello Gilbert Clark,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your email has caught my attention. It's quite surprising to hear that there is an unpaid sum of Five Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars waiting for me at TD Bank. However, I'm a bit confused about the mention of next of kin and lotto winnings.\n\nCould you please provide more information on how exactly this fund came about? I want to make sure I understand the situation clearly before proceeding further. Additionally, could you explain why someone named Mr. David Taylor claims to be my next of kin and states that I have passed away? This is news to me!\n\nI appreciate your assistance in clarifying these matters. Looking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
