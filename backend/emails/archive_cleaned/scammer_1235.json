And why was it there in the first place? \n\nAlso, I'm curious about how this fund got signed by the White House. What does that mean exactly? \n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but this is all so new and exciting to me. I look forward to hearing more about this.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
