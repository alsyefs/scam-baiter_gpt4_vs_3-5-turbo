        "body": "Hello Dr. Mansur Mukhtar,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. It's quite surprising to hear about the situation regarding my payment. I must admit, it's a bit confusing.\n\nCould you please clarify what the FFSD department is? And could you also explain more about the Diplomatic Preference Carriage Scheme? It sounds interesting but I'm not entirely sure I understand how it works.\n\nI appreciate your advice on being cautious with whom I interact with regarding this matter. However, I'm curious as to why these individuals would want to extort money from me?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about this device that can be used to pay me the money owed? How does it work exactly?\n\nLastly, when you mention \"promissory note of of the fund\", what exactly do you mean by that? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLouis"
