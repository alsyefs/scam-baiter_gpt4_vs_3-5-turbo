The only fee you will pay is the Authorization fee of 585$ to the processing bank. No other payment.\r\n\r\nYou can pay through a bank account or through bitcoin waiting for your kind response.\nTHANKS \r\nMr Roger Gorman"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Roger Gorman,\n\nWow, a million dollars! That's quite a surprise. I'm curious, how did I come to be the recipient of such a large sum? Could you provide more details about this?\n\nAlso, could you explain what the fee to the processing bank is for? And why is there such urgency in this matter?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nIsmael"
