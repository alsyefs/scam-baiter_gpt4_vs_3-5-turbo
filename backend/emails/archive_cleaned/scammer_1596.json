Could you please provide more details about the nature of the business she claims we are involved in? \n\nAlso, I'm not currently in the hospital or sick as she seems to have informed you. It's strange that she would say such a thing.\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
