I\r\nam a new Christian convert, suffering from long term breast cancer.\r\n\r\nAll indications from my doctor are that my condition is really\r\ndeteriorating and it is quite obvious that I wouldn't live more than three\r\nmonths, according to my doctors and in all indications with regards to\r\nmedical analysis. This is because the cancer disease has gotten to a very\r\nbad stage that no hope for me to be a living person again.40 years period\r\nof marriage life, still we could not produce any child, my late husband was\r\nvery wealthy and after his death, I inherited some part of his business and\r\nmoney in the bank.\r\n\r\nThe the most important thing for me here is for you to assure me that the\r\nfunds will be distributed as I mentioned which is my last wish and this is\r\nlegit, I have never been involved in anything illegal and I will not start\r\nit now so if you are interested and ready to carry out my wish as\r\ninstructed then be advised to provide me a copy of your ID and direct\r\ncontact details which will enable me introduce you to my banker as my next\r\nof kin, this is very urgent, I will be looking forward hearing from you.\nRegards\r\nMrs. Cook"
