        "body": "Hello Robert,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate you notifying me about the new development regarding my funds at Mercantile Bank online MBO. It's good to know that the bank has created an online bank account on my behalf and funded it with a balance of USD.\n\nI'm interested in accessing the online bank account and withdrawing money from it. Could you please provide me with more details about how I can obtain the transfer code? You mentioned that there is a payment required for it, but I would like to understand why and how this payment is necessary.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what you mean by sending the payment through Bitcoin or Gift Card? How does that process work exactly?\n\nThank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLee"
