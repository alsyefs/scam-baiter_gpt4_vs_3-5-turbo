Like we stated earlier, the delivery charges have been paid, therefore the only money you were advised to send to them is their official security keeping fee of $25 USD.\nLike I stated earlier, the crediting re-activation, delivery and the company registration charges has been paid by me, but I  did not pay their official security keeping fee since they refused, they refused and the reason is that they do not know when you are going to contact them and the demurrage might have increased by then, They told me that their official  security keeping fee is only $25.00 per a day, and I deposited it yesterday by 10:am in the morning to their office.\nTherefore you should contact them with the below contact information;\nCompany name; DHL Express Customer Service.\nEmail:Email:(\noffilcefile21@gmail.com\n)\nTry to contact them today and also send them the security official security keeping charge to avoid increasing of their fees and let me know once you receive this your ATM VISA CARD. we have agreed together to send the needed fee of the $25.00 through Apple gift card or bitcoin, so that we will meet up in time with your delivery today as we programmed it here already,\nContact them today with your full information requested below;\nYour Full Name;\nYour Country;\nYour Residence Home Address:\nYour Phone cell/whatsapp:\nTry to indicate all this codes to them because it will prove that you are the rightful person that own the ATM visa card deposited in their custody.\nShipment Code awb :33xzs,\nATM Card Registered Code\nNo xgt4  \nSecurity Code sctc:2001dhx:567:\nTransaction Code 233:cstc:101:33028:\nCertificate Deposit code: sctc:bun.xxiv:78:01\nDepositor:Mr Greg Hewitt\nThis is to avoid wrong delivery, do that urgently to avoid an increase of their keeping fees and let us know once you receive your ATM VISA CARD.\nYours sincerely\nMr Greg Hewitt   "

        "body": "Hello Mr. Greg Hewitt,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite exciting to hear about the ATM VISA card. I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain more about how this works? \n\nAlso, I'm curious as to why the money would go into the federal government treasury account if the card expires? Is that a common practice?\n\nYou mentioned that you've already paid some fees on my behalf, which is very kind of you. However, I'm not sure I understand why there's an official security keeping fee and why it wasn't included in the initial payment.\n\nI'd also like to know more about DHL Express Customer Service. Are they a reliable company? Have they been in business for long?\n\nLastly, you mentioned sending the fee through Apple gift card or bitcoin. Could you please elaborate on how that process works?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJessica"
