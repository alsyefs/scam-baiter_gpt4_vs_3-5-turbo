        "body": "Hello Dr. George Lawrence,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. It's great to hear that my funds have been approved and deposited with TNT delivery company.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about these funds? I'm curious to know how this came about as it was quite unexpected. \n\nAlso, could you clarify what exactly is required from my end for the delivery of these funds? You mentioned some personal information but it seems like the list got cut off.\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nPatrice"
