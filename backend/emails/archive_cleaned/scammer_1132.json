        "body": "Hello Donald,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the update regarding my fund and the wire transfer. However, I must clarify that I do not know anyone by the name of E. Aviles from Ohio. It seems there might be some confusion or misunderstanding.\n\nCould you please provide more information about E. Aviles and why he claims to have my mandate to receive the funds on my behalf? How did he come to know about my situation? Also, could you explain why he mentioned that I am ill?\n\nI want to ensure that everything is in order before proceeding with any transactions. Your assistance in clarifying these matters would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
