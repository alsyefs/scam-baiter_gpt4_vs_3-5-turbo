Of course, I responded immediately and was\r\nwondering why you didn't get my message or replied to it until a few\r\ndays ago after sending a reminder. Like I informed earlier in my\r\nimmediate past response, I live and work in the states and the funds\r\nare here too.\r\n\r\n The transfer costs/fees will be subtracted and charged from the\r\nfunds. You and I will handle the onetime payment of the legal and\r\ndocumentation fees. However, I am honest, and this transaction is\r\nreal/legitimate. Here are the attachments of my work I'd and documents\r\nof our late client as proved.\r\n\r\nKindly get back to me for more details if you are interested in this\r\ntransaction.\r\n\nBest Regards.\r\nMary K. Bosell"
