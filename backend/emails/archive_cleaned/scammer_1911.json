My name is Mallam Nurudeen Kyari. I am the first son of late Abba Kyari, the former Chief of Staff to Nigerian former President Muhammadu Buhari. My late father was the director/chairman of Covid-19 Palliatives in Nigeria. Unfortunately he contracted the deadly virus while in Germany for a business meetings with Siemens AG, a meeting meant to cushion the effect of the covid-19 in the countryâ€™s economy; See news website:\nhttps:/ /www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-nigeria-idUSKBN220001\nHe eventually died of the virus and was buried immediately according to Islamic rite. After his death, the distribution of covid-19 palliatives was halted.\nHowever, my late father had left an unexhausted covid-19 palliative sum of $32,000,000 (thirty-two million US Dollars) in a bank (bank name not mentioned for confidential purposes). No member of our family can effectively reclaim this fund for our benefits without the government clamping down. So we have decided to seek a foreigner, have an Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and transfer the ownership of the fund to him/her custody for foreign investment in accordance with the Terms of MOU.\nNote: It is confidential. It is 100% legal, 100% official and 100% risk-free. All the fund deposit documents of the deceased which will be transferred to you upon your acceptance are with the family. Please if you are not interested do not expose the family secret.\nKindly send me; your acceptance letter.\nI await your immediate and positive response.\nSincerely,\nFamily Attorney.\nFOR:\nMallam Nurudeen Kyari (\nnurudeen_kyari@outlook.com\n)\nHead of Kyari Empire, Bornu state-Nigeria.\n "
