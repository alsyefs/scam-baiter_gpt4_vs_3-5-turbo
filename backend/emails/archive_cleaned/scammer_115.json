        "body": "Good morning Michael Eric,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this sounds like a very generous offer from the United Nations and Bank of Erica. However, I have a few questions before I can proceed with providing my banking details.\n\n1. Can you please explain in more detail how the United Nations decided to compensate victims of Nigerian scams? Is there a specific program or initiative that has been set up for this purpose?\n\n2. What kind of legal transfer documents will be processed by Bank of Erica? Are there any fees or charges associated with these documents?\n\n3. You mentioned purchasing Apple cards or steam wallet cards for the transfer charge. Could you please clarify why these specific cards are required and how they will be used in the process?\n\nI appreciate your prompt response and look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nThelma"
