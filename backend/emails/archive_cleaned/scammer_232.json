It's unfortunate that there are fraudulent people out there, but I'm glad to hear that you are reputable and committed to putting an end to such activities.\n\nI must admit, though, that I am a bit confused about the details of this deal. Could you please provide more information about how exactly my funds were denied in the past and how they will be recovered now? Also, what is the purpose of the trunk box mentioned?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know more about the delivery options available. Could you please explain further about the different delivery companies and their associated costs? And why is it necessary for me to choose one of them?\n\nThank you for your understanding.
