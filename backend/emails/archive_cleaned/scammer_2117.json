However, I have a few questions before I proceed.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the funds? How much money is involved and what is the reason for its delay? Also, why did the United States Police command contact you instead of directly contacting me?\n\nI want to ensure that everything is legitimate and in order before taking any further steps. Your assistance in providing additional information would be greatly appreciated.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
