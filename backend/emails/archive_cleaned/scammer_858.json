I appreciate your apology for the delay and understand that there were some minor problems with your payment system.\n\nI would like to confirm the details you mentioned in your email. Could you please provide more information about the fund? What is the purpose of this payment and why was my name selected? \n\nAdditionally, I would like to know more about the process of transferring the funds. How long does it usually take for the funds to be credited into my bank account? Are there any fees or charges associated with this transfer?\n\nLastly, I noticed that you mentioned a person named Donald who claims to have submitted an affidavit regarding my payment.
