        "body": "Hello David Morgan,\n\nWow, this is such an unexpected surprise! I can't believe my name was chosen for this. It's like winning a lottery without even buying a ticket. \n\nI'm curious though, how did you come across my name? And what exactly is the Original Funds Classified Document (OFCD)? Is it something like a legal document that gives me the right to receive these funds?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that I would need to travel to two different countries. Could you please tell me which countries these are? I've never traveled much before and this sounds like quite an adventure.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nHarry"
