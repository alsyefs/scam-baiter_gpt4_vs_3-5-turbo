        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite surprised to hear about this situation involving Diplomat Jerry Richard and the box of funds. It's a bit confusing, though. Could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, how did you determine that I am the rightful owner of these funds? Also, could you explain why the funds were stopped in the first place? \n\nSecondly, I'm not familiar with paying fees through Itune cards or Steam wallet. Could you provide more information on how this process works?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about Mr. Emmanuel Ken? What is his role in this delivery process?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSelma"
