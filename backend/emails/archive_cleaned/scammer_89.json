I'm not entirely clear on some of the details, though.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about what this fund is and how it came to be unclaimed? Also, could you clarify what the fee is for and why it needs to be paid?\n\nI'm also curious about the process of signing for ownership. How does that work exactly? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarie"
