Of course your email drew my attention to remember\r\nwhen this incident happens last few month precisely last year, It might be\r\ntoo hard to believe that someone would go to such lengths connived with a\r\nstrange and gave him guidelines on how your unpaid payment should be\r\ndiverted.\r\n\r\nThe details I can provide in regards to this situation now is to know if\r\nyou are alive not dead as they claimed with those officials that piloted\r\nthe false information that you are no longer alive. The Saudi man is a\r\nbusinessman and he has a common relationship with the Nigeria past\r\nPresident Mohamadu Buhari so it was during his tenure this their criminal\r\narrangement was executed with some of those government officials.\r\n\r\nBasically,with the connections he has here made him to go far paying fees\r\nas the beneficiary of the contract sum, all the fees required from various\r\nministries has been taken care of by him,he paid all the processing fees\r\nsuch as '' Contract Award Certificate, Proof of Ownership of the Fund,CBN\r\nClaim ownership Fund, Approved order from the Ministry of Finance etc.\r\n\r\nAs you wish to know the role the presidency played in all of this matter,\r\nThe presidency stopped the Debt Management Office (DMO) for given him their\r\nendorsement when he failed to present his original documents of his visit\r\nto Nigeria as a contractor that was where his problem started because his\r\ngood friend president Buhari's government is no more in power, so the new\r\nelected president Ahmed Bola Tinubu gave an instruction not to release the\r\ncontract payment to anyone until investigations are done accordingly.\r\n\r\nFinally, now you have contacted me with the good news that you are alive,\r\nwe should proceed with the evidence of your details that you are alive such\r\nas.\r\n\r\nYour Full Name:\r\n\r\nHome Address:\r\n\r\nCountry/City\r\n\r\nFirst page of your passport is required which has to be submitted to the\r\nfinance ministry that you alive.\r\n\r\nYour Bank details:\r\n\r\nYour telephone Number and your current email address.\r\n\r\nSo if I can get those 5 items today, by tomorrow I will submit it to\r\nfinance ministry and they will call for your immediate transfer payment.\r\n\r\nI wait for your email,\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDanladi Ahmed"
