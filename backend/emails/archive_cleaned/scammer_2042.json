        "body": "Hello Larry Smith,\n\nWow, this sounds like an amazing opportunity! I can't believe my luck. I have a few questions though, if you don't mind.\n\nFirstly, how did I come to be the recipient of such a large sum? It's not every day that someone offers me five million dollars!\n\nSecondly, could you please provide more details about this VISA DEBIT CARD? How does it work exactly?\n\nLastly, you mentioned a payment for the shipment of the debit visa card. Could you tell me more about this? What is the cost and how should it be paid?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
