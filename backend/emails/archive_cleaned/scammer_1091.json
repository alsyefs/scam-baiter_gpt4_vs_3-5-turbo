        "body": "Hello Dr. Frank Kelley,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite surprising to hear about this approved fund of million dollars. I must say, it's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nI'm curious though, how did this come about? I don't recall having any dealings with the FIRST BANK OF NIGERIA PLC. Could you provide more details on this matter?\n\nAs for my banking details and driver's license, I'm afraid I can't share those online due to security reasons. However, I'd be happy to continue our conversation and learn more about this situation.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nNancy"
