I't is my pleasure to meet with you here on the internet. I know we have not met before but my instincts led me to discuss a very important project with you that will change lives for good and I promised you will never regret this offer trust me. I’m currently hospitalized in a private hospital here in Texas as a result of brain cancer. My purpose for writing to you is for a charity project with your help, the fund that I have in my private account in Burkina Faso.\nIt is clear that I’m approaching the last days of my life according to the doctor. I’m offering the sum of $4.2 Million to anybody that will invest the fund wisely into profitable business ventures and donate part of the profit earned from the investment to charity work worldwide; I am helpless to do so as a result of my health, I urge you to help me fulfill my wish.\nAs soon as I receive your positive response, I will detail and also direct you on what to do.\nRegards,\nMs. Ella H Jonathan"
