It's truly commendable what the INTERPOL Police is doing to fight cyber crime, internet fraud, and money laundering. I'm glad to hear that so many fraudsters have been apprehended and that a significant amount of money has been recovered.\n\nI'm curious about the process of refunding the lost funds to their legitimate owners. How does it work? And how did my reference Email id end up with one of the fraudsters in your detention room?\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on why the UN has decided that foreign payment should be via ATM Master Card only? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMillard"
