        "body": "Hello Mrs. Joy Anu,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. It's great to hear about your success and the new investment projects you're working on in France. That sounds very exciting!\n\nI'm also glad to know that you remember my past efforts, even though they didn't quite work out as we had hoped. I appreciate your kind gesture of wanting to send me an ATM CARD with a total sum of five hundred thousand United States dollars.\n\nHowever, before proceeding further, I have a few questions if you don't mind:\n\n1) Could you please provide more details about how this ATM card works? \n2) How can I use it safely without any issues?\n3) Is there any specific reason why the funds are being sent through an ATM card instead of a direct bank transfer?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrank"
