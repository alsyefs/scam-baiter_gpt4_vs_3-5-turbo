From my position\r\nas a European Secretary, I discovered that they moved your fund of US$37.5\r\nMillion to Switzerland Europe several months ago with intention of sharing\r\nit between themselves if they had succeeded .\r\n\r\nJust last weeks I found out through the Central computer data-base that\r\nthey are about to re-route your fund from Bank of Europe to Credit  Suisse\r\nGroupe Switzerland before European Financial Regulators traced the money, I\r\nfelt that it is important for me to alert you on this development.\r\n\r\nThey are still using your name and inheritance identification number as the\r\nbeneficiary but they have changed the account co-ordinate claiming that you\r\nwere the person who asked them to represent you and authorized them to\r\ntransferred the money out of Europe to Asia. This was the reason why they\r\nasked you for endless fee to frustrate you so as to abandon the claim for\r\nthem to enrich themselves,\r\n\r\nI have found out that Mr.Christian Sewing Chairman are using your money to\r\ntrade at the International Market buying stocks and making interest while\r\ndelaying your payment. These officials use delay tactics to hold on to your\r\npayment while they make money. They will tell you that your transfer or\r\ncheck will be delivered today and when that time comes, they will come up\r\nwith another excuse why your payment was stopped or cancelled.\r\n\r\nI am contacting you secretly believing that you will keep this as top\r\nsecret.

Your payment is supposed to\r\ngo through the Swiss credit control financial clearing house before finally\r\nLodge into their Swiss account the European\r\nfinancial regulators traced the fund.\r\n\r\nNOTE I repeat, please do not expose my person, it is not easy to help you\r\nreceive your funds. You are hereby advised to purchase $100 Nordstrom card\r\nor Sephora Card or Steam Wallet Gift Card $100 to enable me obtain your Tax\r\nClearance papers for immediate release your funds, I have worked out\r\nmodalities on how this transfer will be effected to your account\r\nimmediately for you to start enjoying your benefits.\r\n\r\nI ask that you keep this very secret and confidential until transfer is\r\nconfirmed in your account or via ATM Card depending on your choice. Just\r\nstop communicating with the wicked Mr.Christian Sewing Chairman of\r\nthe Board and don't even answer any of his mails again.
