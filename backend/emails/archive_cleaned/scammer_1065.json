I want to bring to\nyour Notice that, on my routine Monthly investigation of every USPS\nOffice visiting, i discovered an abandoned Parcel containing an ATM\nCard worth of IS ($450, 000.00) in one of our offices.

The\nPostmaster in that branch (Mr. Bernard Coleman) fail to mail it as\nprogrammed, due to the incorrect information.\nI have made the arrangement of mailing the ATM Card Parcel to you. So,\nI'm sending you this message to get back with your current mailing\naddress to enable us to mail it for you.\nNow, i want to mail the ATM Card Parcel for you by myself as i have\nmade the arrangement of mailing it to you. I discussed it with the\nWhite House and all Homeland Securities including FBI and they have\nall given me the go head order to mail it for you immediately, you\nreconfirm your mailing address to this office in order for us to mail\nthe ATM Card directly to you after sending the mailing fee which is\nust US$50.\nNote, below is the officially information needed for posting of the\nATM CARD ASAP.\nFull name:_____\nFull mailing Address:_____\nYour cell phone no:_____\nNationality:____\nID card copy\n:___\nWe shall mail the ATM Card for you once you update us with the above\ninformation and \nthe Postal Stamp fee of US$ only via BTC or Steam Wallet card\nUS$50 or Apple  Gift Card of US$50\n as a matter of\nrgency and Deliver you.\nBest Regards,\nMrs Cheryl Pierce Viger"

        "body": "Hello Mrs Cheryl Pierce Viger,\n\nWow, that's quite a surprise! I had no idea there was an ATM card waiting for me. It's really kind of you to take the time to inform me about this. \n\nI'm curious though, how did my name and email address end up on the parcel? And why would it be sent via USPS? I don't remember expecting any ATM cards.\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the Postal Stamp fee? Why is it necessary and why does it need to be paid through BTC or Steam Wallet card or Apple Gift Card?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nChrista"
