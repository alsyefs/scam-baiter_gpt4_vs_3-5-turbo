        "body": "Hello Jo Whelan,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. It's quite surprising to hear about these funds, as I wasn't aware of them being held in transit. \n\nCould you please provide more information about this situation? For instance, how did my local and lawyers get involved in this? And what exactly is the role of Optimax Trading Limited in all of this?\n\nI'm also curious about the UK Debt Management Office's involvement. How does your department fit into this picture?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLucile"
