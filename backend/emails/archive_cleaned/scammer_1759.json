        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm intrigued by your message and the opportunity to receive my payment. However, I have a few questions that I hope you can help clarify.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why the payment was left in your custody? Also, how did it come about that there's a bill of sum amount of money required for me to receive my payment?\n\nSecondly, could you provide more details about this special bonus you mentioned? It sounds interesting but I would like to understand it better.\n\nLastly, regarding the Google Play CARD or Steam Wallet method of payment, could you elaborate on how this works? How does the card get redeemed into cash?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon with these clarifications.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
