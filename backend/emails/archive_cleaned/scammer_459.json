        "body": "Dear David Champion,\n\nGood day! I hope this message finds you well. \n\nI must say, your email has taken me by surprise. While I do know a Mr. Hasrul, our relationship is purely of a personal nature and not business-related. We certainly don't have any joint investments in Indonesia or elsewhere.\n\nAs for the address in Indonesia, I'm afraid there seems to be some confusion. I am not currently residing in Indonesia nor have plans to move there anytime soon.\n\nCould you please provide more details about these funds? How did they come under my name? And what exactly is the role of Mr. Hasrul in all this?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJesse"
