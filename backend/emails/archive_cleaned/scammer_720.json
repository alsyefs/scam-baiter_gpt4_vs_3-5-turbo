        "body": "Dear Judge Joan Donoghue,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the issue of my trapped funds in Nigeria. I appreciate your efforts in helping individuals like myself who have been facing difficulties in accessing their funds.\n\nI would like to know more about the initiative you mentioned, particularly how it works and what steps need to be taken to secure the release and payment of my funds. Could you please provide me with more details on the process?\n\nAdditionally, I am curious about the ICJ Protection that you mentioned. How does it work exactly? What kind of protection does it offer, and how will it ensure that I won't face any issues after receiving the payment?\n\nLastly, I would like to understand the role of the United Nations in this program. How are they involved, and what measures do they take to ensure that all foreigners who are owed funds receive them in a timely manner?\n\nThank you once again for your assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKim"
