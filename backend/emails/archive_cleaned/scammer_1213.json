        "body": "Hello Dr. William Rogers,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe I'm one of the lucky winners. I've always admired BMW cars and now to think that I might own one is just incredible.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain a bit more about how my email was selected? And what exactly does the Awareness Promotion Department do? \n\nAlso, could you tell me more about this BMW car that's part of the prize? What model is it? Is it new or used?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRaymond"
