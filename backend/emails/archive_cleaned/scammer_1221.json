        "body": "Hello Mr. James Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite surprised to hear about this situation, but also relieved that the US government is taking steps to rectify it.\n\nI'm curious about the options you've provided for the release of my money. Could you please provide more details on how each option works? For instance, how long would a bank-to-bank transfer take? And what are the procedures involved in home delivery or receiving an ATM Master Card?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"interrupt any further with you and anyone\"? I'm not sure I understand that part.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJoyce"
