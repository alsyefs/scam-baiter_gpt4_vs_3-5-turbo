        "body": "Hello Juliet Arias,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't aware that such a fund had been approved in my name. \n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about the part where you mentioned an associate of mine from Indonesia. I don't recall authorizing anyone to receive funds on my behalf. Could you please provide more details about this person? How did they claim to be associated with me?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about how this fund was approved? What were the criteria and who made the decision?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nKayla"
