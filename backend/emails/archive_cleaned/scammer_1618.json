        "body": "Hello Raymond Wood and Mrs. Raymond Wood,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite interesting to hear about these unclaimed benefits and funds. I must admit, I'm not very familiar with how all of this works.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about the process? How does the Monetary Fund IMF identify these unclaimed funds and benefits? And how do they decide who is eligible to receive them?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRandall"
