        "body": "Hello Kristalina Georgieva,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm sorry to hear about the mix-up with Mr. Virgle Lee Samples, but I can assure you that I am very much alive and well.\n\nI'm quite surprised to learn about this overdue payment. Could you please provide more details? For instance, how did my email end up on this list? And what is the origin of these funds?\n\nAlso, could you clarify why the fund has been located to CITI BANK LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM? Is there a specific reason for this?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichelle"
