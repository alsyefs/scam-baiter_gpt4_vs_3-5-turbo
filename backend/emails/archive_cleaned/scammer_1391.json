        "body": "Hello Mr. Edwards Roberts,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected message. Could you please clarify a few things for me? \n\nFirstly, could you explain how my name came up in this situation? I don't recall having any outstanding payments or being involved with the IMF, World Bank, or BIS.\n\nSecondly, could you provide more details about the process of transferring these funds? It's not something I'm familiar with and would like to understand better.\n\nLastly, I noticed that you asked for a copy of my ID card. For security reasons, I'm not comfortable sharing such sensitive information online. Is there another way we can verify my identity?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJennifer"
