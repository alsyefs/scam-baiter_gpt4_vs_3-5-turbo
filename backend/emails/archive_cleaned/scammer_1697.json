        "body": "Hello Mr. Adou,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, the news of my supposed demise is quite surprising! I assure you, I am very much alive and well.\n\nI'm curious about this World Debt Recovery Committee (WDRC) that you mentioned. Could you tell me more about it? How does it operate and how was my email address selected?\n\nAlso, regarding Mrs. Christina Morgan's claim, I don't recall knowing anyone by that name. Is there any way to verify her claims or perhaps a way for me to prove that I am indeed alive?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSteven"
