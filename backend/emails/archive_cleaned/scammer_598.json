I'm curious, though, could you please explain a bit more about these legal documents that need to be secured on my behalf? What exactly do they entail?\n\nAlso, I'm wondering why the diplomatic agent isn't aware that the boxes contain funds. Is this a standard procedure in such operations?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAlbert"
