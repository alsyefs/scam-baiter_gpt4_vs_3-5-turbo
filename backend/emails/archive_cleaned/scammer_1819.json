        "body": "Greetings to your personality\nMy name is Mrs Patricia Alamini a Christian born on August 22 1956 in Kenya I had to contact you in this way because I want to get rid of a burden that is most important to me There is always a reason when a person is not going well different reasons that one can show or not show. But sometimes for certain reasons some mistakes can be done so badly that someone can not forget them I can not pass over I am obliged to show this evil that invaded me at this moment We simply have to move forward close this scar and not turn around turn away the gaze from passing and live in the present\nIndeed my heart is sick because I am affected by an illness that has been degrading my life for almost a year According to the Doctor the Blood Ball that settled in the brain is at a very advanced level and therefore any surgery would be a failure in advance I am afraid that the rest of my money will be about 5 000 000 00 Euros\nI am afraid that the rest of my fortune will be a mess after my death of course I do not know you but after a long reflection and through my prayers I made this decision to contact you This fortune better serves elsewhere and lets others benefit from it more in need than in care that actually only ruins my life\nI therefore ask you to accept this offer which I wish to offer you at your disposal to help the destitute build help centers orphanages hospitals and church if you agree I expect your answer to my message on my private mail Please pray for me because I am in a critical situation get back to me if you are ready to make good use of the money like I stated \nI am currently in the United Arab Emirates Dubai receiving treatment\n but my condition is not good I want you to get back to me after reading my email because my condition is getting worse and I don't know if I will survive or not but I want you to accomplish my wishes by building help centers orphanages hospitals and churches\nBest Regards\nMrs. Patricia Alamini\nGreetings to your personality"
