I am therefore compensating you based on my promise to you at that time. Please reach out to the below contact person at Union Bank.\nName: Mr.Steven Adebayo\nPosition: Head of Banking Operations\nEmail: \nstevenadebayohboperations@gmail.com\nMy partner has given him instruction to release the $500,000.00 (Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar) to you.I was told the Bank cannot make a direct wire remittance to you; rather they will issue an electronic payment card and load the money in it and then ship to your designated address. I hope with this, I have kept and fulfilled my promise to you. \nRegards to your beautiful family and let me know when you get the money.\nThank you.\nMrs Selina Nnabuchi"

I must admit, your email took me by surprise as I don't recall our previous interaction regarding a business proposal.\n\nHowever, it's interesting to hear about the completion of the Acqunetta fund process and the subsequent transfer to Union Bank. The mention of Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar is quite intriguing.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this electronic payment card? How does it work? And how can I ensure its safety during shipment?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJamie"
