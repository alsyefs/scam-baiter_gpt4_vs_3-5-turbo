Could you explain how the daily payments will be made? Is there a specific process or platform for receiving them?\n\n4. You mentioned a Walmart Reference number. How does this relate to my payment? Can you provide more details on how it works?\n\n5. I would like to understand why I need to purchase a gift card for Mr. Christ Richard in order to activate my first payment.
