How a\nre you doing today and your health together with your work and family? Hope Fi\nne? I am a staff at the Customs Service and while going through some of the fi\nles in my office, I discovered that some foreigners are being used and dumped\nby some of our Directors, Comptroller-General of Customs, and some of the Gove\nrnment officials. Please be informed that your consignment box worth of $5,200\n,000.00 Million dollars was approved to be released to you. I have found out t\nhat these top officials are using your money to trade at the International Mar\nket buying stocks and making interest while delaying the diplomatic agent to c\nomplete the delivery to your home address.\nJust last week they introduced two men's by the name Mr. William Nolan and Mr.\n Caviezel Harrison, they came to our claiming this money on your behalf. they\nsaid that you are dead, that you authorize them to claim the money when you be\ncame so sick at the hospital that they're your brothers. When our Official Not\ne was submitted to my desk for final Approvals before forwarding it to Board f\nor endorsement, I noticed that there are discrepancies as there was no evidenc\ne of authorization letter from you for them to receive this funds on your beha\nlf. I urgently summoned The Official responsible for the presentation of the w\ninning and directed him to stop the movement of the funds and at the same time\n placed a stop order instruction on the funds pending when your views and comm\nents are received with regards to this matter. I hereby urged you to email/tex\nt me urgently for your comments which will be highly appreciated if you are st\nill alive or not on sick bed.\nIn my further search I found out that some of the Beneficiaries are not even a\nware of this payment. They don't even know that such payments exist for them.\nI am contacting you secretly believing that you will keep this as top secret b\necause they are trying to claim this funds. I want to work with you to move th\ne consignment direct to your home address within 24 hours, \nthe only money you\nwill pay is the sum of $50.00 for customs clearance\n. Please one thing I must a\nsk of you is to keep this secret until this consignment box is delivered to yo\nu at your doorstep. If you will not be able to handle the secret let me know,\nwhat I want is to see that justice is done and your money will be delivered to\n you within 24 hours.\nRegards and God bless,\nEmail::: \nryanmrchristopher@gmail.com\nPhone Num:: +1 (904) 723-8365\nMr. Christopher Ryan."
