        "body": "  Dear  Sir,\nI know this will come to you as a surprise but I chose to tell you the truth because of my Sincere wish to treat every man, as I would expect to be treated. My name is Dr.Joshua Umar, a management staff of the Federal Ministry of Finance. Following the directive from the office of the president of the federal republic of Nigeria President Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a thorough investigation was conducted on all foreign contract payment file including all contract awarded in past by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC) and other government agencies with directors of all commercial banks in charges of all inheritance funds in Nigeria.\nDuring the exercise, we discovered that some payment files has been abandoned unclaimed for a long time due to some stringent logistics,I noticed that it will take a long process for this money to be released due to some irregularities detected. During our investigation, we found out that some foreign contractors /inheritance beneficiaries had spent so much money in trying to realize this contract payment, which did not even reflect in the file here.\nPlease find here under the posing reasons why they have not been able to get the money so far. Those who intimately/introduced there foreign partner into the transaction were unable to Draw a Bilateral/Binding Agreement with them as Sub-Contractor thereby, denying them being issued with contractors certified Job card, although the fund is still existing in their respective payment agencies here in Nigeria as over invoice contract fund from contract awarded by the NNPC some years back.\nIn view of this I have proffered solution to fill up the vacuum that will facilitate the ease movement of the funds into your bank account hitch-free. Upper mostly please note that you are not the original contractor/inheritance the fund in question is just emanated from over invoice contract awarded from the office of (NNPC). This total sum of which will be shared between you and I in the ratio of 50:50. only if you agree by my terms and conditions as stated above Having meticulously worked out the modalities and logistics, with my position and as part of my profession, I will be solely responsible of re-verifying all the mutilated and battered documents related to this matter and report back to you for revalidating such documents to give it all required legal backing to according to Nigerian new financial laws.\nI am offering you this because as civil servants, we do not have the necessary foreign account machinery to successfully handle this transaction. Therefore it becomes necessary to source for a foreign company or individual with the capability to act as the original beneficiary of the contract /Inheritance.It is a good thing that the president has endorsed the resolution passed by the senate committee on foreign contract payment that all foreign Contractors/inheritance beneficiaries owed by the federal government of Nigeria and its agencies should be paid, we will seize this good opportunity to purport you as one of the beneficiaries to be paid.the process needed for these funds to be transferred into your account are as follows.\n(A) New account details for the remittance of the above sum which shall be normalize at the federal high court to tally with the transfer of this\npayment.\n(B)Your direct contact deatils.\n(C) A copy of your international passport or any valid ID.\nIf you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account.I do not particularly know you so I would wait on your response to judge your level of transparency and honesty need not you disappear after the money gets into your coffers with a level of understanding between us I will start the initiation of this process towards a conclusion. I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account, as this transaction will not be done under the clock of my employer. Contact will be through my personal numbers and also through above email address same could apply to you if you wish. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.\nA very dear friend of mine and university classmate Mr.Idris Aluko of Zenith Bank had to quit his job in May last year when unethical material was found on his office computer during a routine maintenance of his machine and the results of the internal investigation were leaked to the local press seriously denting his career after all the service, good work and sacrifice he had given the banking industry.\nPlease observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man, I have wife and children.I send you this mail not without a measure of doubt as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.This is the one truth I have learnt.\nDo not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should plan a meeting soon.\nI await your response by return email. If you wish to call me do not hesitate to call on my direct private mobile line +234-8027660664 or acknowledge the receipt of this email immediately.\nYours Sincerely,\nDr.Joshua Umar   "
