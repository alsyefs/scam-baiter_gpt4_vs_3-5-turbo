Please let us move forward on this fund for our benefit and interest. But before I can do this,you must be willing to part with 50% of the whole fund worth USD 10.7 MILLION and you must follow the bank rules and regulations accordingly\nIf you are really serious and ready I will need your valid international passport with your current contact details address,whatsapp number Occupation for the transfer process.\nMay God's blessing remain with you.\nMr.Frederick Caiger\nEmail: \nfredericks11958@gmail.com\n "
