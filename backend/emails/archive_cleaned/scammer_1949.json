It's strange that she would say such a thing.\n\nI'm curious about this cash box you mentioned. Can you tell me more about it? How did it come to be in my name? And why does Mrs. Vivian Henry want to claim it?\n\nAlso, could you explain what the Tunes card or Steam Wallet gift card is for? I've never used one before.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
