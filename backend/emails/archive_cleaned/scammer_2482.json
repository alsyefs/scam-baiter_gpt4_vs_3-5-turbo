        "body": "Hello Mr. Fred Moore,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from United Bank for Africa UBA Uganda. I appreciate your willingness to assist me with transferring my unclaimed fund. However, before I provide any personal information, I would like to ask a few questions to ensure the legitimacy of this transaction.\n\n1. How did you come across my unclaimed fund? Can you provide some background information on how it became unclaimed?\n\n2. Is there any specific reason why the Board of Directors Trustees has chosen UBA Bank in Uganda to handle this transfer?\n\n3. Could you please explain the process and timeline for transferring the funds into my bank account? Are there any fees or charges involved?\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nHelen"
