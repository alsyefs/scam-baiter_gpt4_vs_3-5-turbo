        "body": "Without mincing words, I am convinced 100% that you have had bitter\r\nexperience with various scammers' claiming to be high government officials\r\nand thereby defrauding you of your' hard earned money. The activities of\r\nthese scammers has changed your perspective about conducting business on\r\nthe internet, and you now believed there is no genuine business that can be\r\nconducted on the internet.\r\n\r\nWell, I am an American and the internet was created by the Americans for\r\nthe purpose of creating awareness for your products/services and conducting\r\ngenuine business with ease. I am fully committed to deliver the \"diplomatic\r\nconsignment\" to you in United State, in order to differentiate myself from\r\nthe many Benin Republic you have dealt with. I am a full citizen of the\r\nUnited States, but I was on a Foreign Mission here in Benin as a US\r\nAmbassador. Hence, I am making every efforts to ensure that no citizen of\r\nthe United States is cheated by Benin Republic.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I need your utmost support and understanding to actualize this\r\ndream. I also want you to understand that I do trust you and I expect you\r\nto show me the same trust and respect in return since trust is a 2way\r\nstreet. On the other hand, trust is a relationship of reliance. Trust also\r\nmeans being able to predict what other people will do and what situations\r\nwill occur. Trust is both an emotional and logical act. Emotionally, it is\r\nwhere you expose your vulnerabilities to people, but believing they will\r\nnot take advantage of your openness. Logically, it is where you have\r\nassessed the probabilities of gain and loss, calculating expected utility\r\nbased on hard performance data, and concluded that the person in question\r\nwill behave in a predictable manner. In practice, trust is a bit of both. I\r\ntrust you because I have experienced your trust worthiness by merely\r\nbelieving in what I have said, even when you have not seen me, and because\r\nI have faith in human nature.\r\n\r\nFrankly speaking, I understand that anyone in your shoes will feel\r\nbetrayed, but I still want you to show me your trust by giving me the\r\nbenefit of doubt on this delivery arrangement. My identity and personality\r\nis verifiable, and I promise to deliver the consignment to you in United\r\nState, without any hitch. Please do not allow this mission to die off\r\nbecause of $250.00 dollars. I meant so well for you and I believe you will\r\nappreciate me more when you have finally received your partial payment of\r\n$25,000,000,00 dollars upon my arrival with the package in United State. I\r\nwill use my position and personality to deposit the $25,000,000,00 dollars\r\ninto your bank account in United State, without questioning from the\r\nfinancial monitoring authorities, since all documentations proving the\r\nlegitimacy of the funds has been processed.\r\n\r\nPlease don't see me as one of the numerous dubious Benin republic you have\r\ndealt with in the past. I am a different person entirely and I came from a\r\ndifferent continent. I have the American spirit in me and I hate cheaters.\r\nI promise to always uphold the national unity of the United States. Please\r\nreply back ASAP and let me know your possibility of sending the $250.00\r\ndollars today. You can send it via Ria or world Remit or iTunes card or\r\nsteam wallet card.\r\n\r\nTrusting to hear from you immediately.\nRegards\r\nAmbassador Brian Shukan"
