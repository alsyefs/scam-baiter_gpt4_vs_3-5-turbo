        "body": " This is to acquaint you with the outcome of our 3 days meeting which ended on the 12th November with the U.N International Financial Investigation Unit in conjunction with the Association of Better Business Bureau to compensate scam victims upon due verification and Approval for this Year 2023 last quarter.\nWe have jointly approved US$950,000.00(Nine Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars Only) for every confirmed victim. Your E-mail address was generated through the computer ballot system as one of the selected victims to receive this fund.\nIn the course of our investigation, your email address/particulars were shortlisted among the first fifteen individuals yet to be paid hence this email. However, we received a petition today from one Ms Christina Morgan that you are dead. According to her, you died of COVID-19 complications and as such your fund should be paid to her as the apparent heiress. She has also submitted her Bank account with Bank of America for the transfer of the fund to her.\nTo avoid undue delay or paying the fund to the wrong individual/beneficiary, we have decided to contact you for confirmation. If we fail to hear from you after 72 hours, it will be assumed that the petition is true and the fund will be paid to her without further delay.\nHowever, adequate arrangements have been put in place for you to reclaim your fund and also for your fund to be doled out to you through Online Wire Deposit or by issuing an ATM Card to you which would be courier to your mailing address through our accredited courier company.\nFinally for the purpose of proper verification of your claims, it is imperative that you furnish us with the following of your details necessary to process release/remittance of your payment:\nYour Full Name(s):\nYour Cell Number:\nContact Address:\nAge:\nYour I.D:\nYou are expected to Reply to this email with the above requested information:\nNOTE: You are also requested to stop any further communication with any other person(s) or office(s) to avoid any hitch in receiving your payment as Scheduled.\nBest Regards,\nZaghloul Hatem.\nChief Executive Officer.\nBetter Business Bureau(BBB).\n*CONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: This message and its contents are confidential and are intended solely for the use of the addressee.

However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. Can you please explain how the computer ballot system selected my email address as one of the victims?\n\n2. Who is Ms. Christina Morgan, and why does she claim to be the apparent heiress of my compensation fund?\n\n3. What steps can I take to prove that I am indeed alive and entitled to receive the compensation fund?\n\n4. Could you provide more details about the Online Wire Deposit or issuing an ATM Card? Which option would be more secure and convenient for me?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nEleanore"
