        "body": "Hello MR. Antony J. Blinken,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the situation. I must say, it's quite a surprise to learn that there's an ATM Visa Card loaded with such a significant amount of money waiting for me.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name end up on this list? And why is the payment being made through an ATM Visa Card? It seems like an unusual method for transferring funds.\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the LEGAL STAY OF PROCEED from the Supreme Court of USA? I'm not familiar with this term or its implications.\n\nLastly, I noticed that you mentioned purchasing Apple iTunes card or Staem Wallet card for making the payment. Could you clarify why these specific methods are required?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichelle"
