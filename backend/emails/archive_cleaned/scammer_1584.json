        "body": "Hello Mdherakg Bangla,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope you're doing well. I have a few questions regarding the transfer of money and the use of an ATM Visa card.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the source of this money? You mentioned it was taken by an old politician, but I would like to understand the legalities and origins of these funds.\n\n2. How much money are we talking about here? It would be helpful to know the approximate amount before proceeding further.\n\n3. Is there any specific reason why you want to transfer this money to my country? Are there any legal implications or restrictions that I should be aware of?\n\n4. Could you explain how the process of obtaining and using the ATM Visa card works? What are the fees involved, if any?\n\n5. Lastly, can you clarify what percentage of the money I would be entitled to keep for myself?\n\nI appreciate your time in answering these questions. Once I have a better understanding of the situation, we can discuss further steps.\n\nBest wishes,\nPhyllis"
