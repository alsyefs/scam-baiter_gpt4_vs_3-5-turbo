        "body": "Hello Daniella Chavez,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about this contract payment trunk box worth Eight million dollars. I don't recall having any dealings with the Custom Authority at JFK John F. Kennedy Airport New York.\n\nI'm also surprised to hear about Mrs Jane Frederick claiming my fund. Could you please provide more information on how she got involved in this? \n\nYou mentioned that I need to pay half of the charges through an Apple Card or Razergold Card. Could you explain why these specific methods of payment are required?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMabel"
