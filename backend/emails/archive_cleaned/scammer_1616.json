Please be\nassured that this correspondence is legitimate, confidential, and seeks your assistance in a matter of utmost importance.\nAllow me to introduce myself Michael Lexington a Solicitor. I find myself in a situation that requires a reliable and trustworthy individual, and After careful consideration, I believe you may be the right person to assist.\nRecently, a close associate of mine in Ukraine, with whom I collaborated in the past, met an unfortunate fate during the country's crisis. This individual, the late\nMr. Kozunenko, owned private gas production companies in Ukraine. Presently, his son seeks assistance in retrieving funds from a deposit held by a Royal Security Company in the United States. Due to the current circumstances, a bank-to-bank transfer is unfeasible.\nThe son has requested my help in finding a Foreign Partner who can stand as the beneficiary for the shipment\n, as stipulated in the agreement between his late father and the security company. I am unable to assist directly as I was present when the shipment was deposited, and a third party is required for the release.\nIf you are willing to participate in this venture, you will act as the Foreign Partner and beneficiary of the shipment for Young Master Bishop. The agreed distribution funds is as follows: 40% for Mr. Kozunenko's son, 30% for myself, and 30% for you.\nI want to emphasize the importance of trust and dedication in this undertaking. I can assure you that this project carries no risk, and I will provide guidance to\nensure its successful completion. Following the safe delivery of the shipment, a representative from Mr. Mark Bishop will meet with you in your country to discuss further details regarding disbursement and investment.\nIf you find this proposal of interest, kindly furnish the following information:\nFull Name\nFull Contact Address\nDirect Mobile Number\nAny Government-Issued Identity for identification purposes\nOnce I receive this information, I will provide you with additional details.\nThank you for considering this matter.

        "body": "Hello Michael Lexington,\n\nI hope this message finds you in good health. I must say, your email has certainly piqued my interest. It's not every day that one receives such a unique proposition.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate fate of Mr. Kozunenko and the predicament his son is currently facing. The situation in Ukraine is indeed troubling, and I can only imagine how difficult it must be for them.\n\nThe role you've described as a Foreign Partner sounds intriguing, although I must admit, it's quite new to me. Could you perhaps elaborate more on what exactly this role entails? What would be expected of me in this position?\n\nAlso, could you provide more information about the Royal Security Company? How did they come into possession of these funds and why are they unable to release them directly to Mr. Kozunenko's son?\n\nAs for the distribution of funds, I appreciate your transparency in sharing this information upfront. However, I'm curious as to why my share would be less than yours or Mr. Kozunenko's son's share? \n\nLastly, regarding the personal details you've requested - while I understand their necessity for communication purposes, I'm afraid I can't provide them at this stage without knowing more about this venture and its legitimacy.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
