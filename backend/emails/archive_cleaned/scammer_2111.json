However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the State Treasury that authorized this transfer? I would like to know more about their role in this process.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the transfer clearance form? Why is it necessary to obtain it before picking up the first payment?\n\n3. Could you clarify how the daily transfer limit works? How much will be transferred each day until I receive the total amount?\n\n4. Is there any specific reason why the fee for obtaining the clearance form needs to be paid through Bitcoin, Cash APP, Zelle, or Gift Cards? Are there alternative payment methods available?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed with this transaction.\n\nBest wishes,\nKeri"
