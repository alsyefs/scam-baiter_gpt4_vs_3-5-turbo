        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. It's quite interesting to hear about the meeting held at the World Bank and the decisions made there. I'm curious, how often do these meetings occur? \n\nAlso, it's great to know that my fund is now being handled by UBA Bank Plc in Lagos, Nigeria. Could you tell me more about this bank? How long has it been in operation?\n\nI noticed that there are several courier companies listed for the delivery of the ATM card. Is there a particular reason why these specific companies were chosen?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
