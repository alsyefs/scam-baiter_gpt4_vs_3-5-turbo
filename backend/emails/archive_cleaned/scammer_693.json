        "body": "Greetings and seasonal compliments,\r\n\r\nI am Edhon Bernasconi, a legal representative specializing in resolution\r\nand probate matters at a prominent law firm based in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nI am reaching out to you following extensive efforts to locate the\r\nsurviving family of Late Eng. Arthur Allene, who unfortunately passed away\r\nintestate (i.e., without a will) due to a ruptured blood vessel in London\r\nnine years ago. There exists an unclaimed Capital Investment Net Profit\r\n(CINP) amounting to US$ 12,950,777.00 with a reputable Investment Company\r\nin the United Kingdom. Given that you share the same family name as the\r\ndeceased, I am seeking your involvement as the  legal beneficiary to\r\nfacilitate the claiming of this investment, including its accrued interests\r\nand policy benefits. Your familial relation is not crucial; rather, your\r\nconsent to proceed with the claims process is what's essential.\r\n\r\nThe Securities and Investment Board (SIB) under the Financial Regulatory\r\nAuthority (FRA) will otherwise take possession of these unclaimed funds in\r\nline with the Financial Services Act 1986, specifically addressing\r\ninvestments and funds inactive for over ten years. We have only a few days\r\nremaining to finalize the termination, claim, and subsequent possession of\r\nthese investment funds.\r\n\r\nOnce this portfolio is secured in your name and the funds are transferred\r\nto your designated bank account through your preferred payment method, I\r\npropose that 10% of the funds be allocated to charities of your choice,\r\nwith 45% each going to you and myself. The process will be conducted\r\nlegally through the competent court's jurisdiction, adhering to the\r\nInheritance Act Claims (Provision for Family and Dependents) Act 1975. This\r\ntitle encompasses statutory provisions regarding inadequate provision\r\nwithin a will or under the Intestacy Law. I have outlined the procedural\r\nstrategies and technicalities, ensuring completion within seven to fourteen\r\nworking days upon receipt of your consent.\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out should you require further details or\r\nclarifications.\r\n\r\nYour prompt response would be greatly appreciated. Wishing you a prosperous\r\n2024.\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nEdhon Bernasconi ( LL.B, LL.M)\r\nAttorney at Law\r\nBrandschenkestrasse 24\r\nCH-8027 Zurich, Switzerlan"

Arthur Allene, it must have been a shock for his family and friends.\n\nI'm intrigued by your message, but I have a few questions if you don't mind. How did you find my contact information? And how are we sure that I am the right person with the same family name as the deceased?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this Capital Investment Net Profit (CINP)? What exactly is it and how was it accrued?\n\nLastly, what would be my responsibilities in this process? You mentioned that my consent is essential, but what does that entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAllene"

        "body": "Dear Allen ,\r\n\r\nI trust this correspondence finds you in good health and spirits. It is\r\nwith great satisfaction that I engage in dialogue with you concerning the\r\naforementioned claim. Permit me to elaborate further on the particulars of\r\nthe subject matter at hand.\r\n\r\nRegrettably, Arthur passed away in London nine years ago due to a ruptured\r\nblood vessel, leaving his estate without a will, thereby rendering it\r\nintestate. To initiate the requisite legal proceedings, I shall arrange a\r\nmeeting with the appropriate court to present our case verbally. Following\r\nthe protocol outlined in the inheritance claim procedures of the United\r\nKingdom, I will then proceed to affirm an Affidavit of Claim, secure an\r\nIndemnity Letter, Administrative Letter, and Non-Residence Participatory\r\nStatus Permit.\r\n\r\nOnce these essential documents are duly prepared, the court will undertake\r\na thorough review, subsequently issuing an acknowledgment confirming the\r\nacceptance of our claim and the closure of the deceased's portfolio with\r\nthe investment company. Subsequently, copies of these court-issued\r\ndocuments will be forwarded to the Treasury for tax clearance and approval,\r\nfacilitating the eventual release of the final funds to your designated\r\nbank account.\r\n\r\nThe total value of the investment stands at $166,966,317, comprising the\r\ndeceased's Initial Capital Deposit (ICD). Additionally, we are asserting a\r\nclaim over the Capital Investment Net Profit (CINP) of US$12,950,777.00,\r\nalongside 2% of the total Investor's Capital Deposit (ICP), amounting to\r\n$3,339,326. This 2% will be disbursed to your account on an annual basis\r\nfor the ensuing decade. However, it is imperative to note that the\r\nInvestor's Initial Capital Deposit (IICD) of $166,966,317 can only be\r\nclaimed after a period of 90 days following the activation and subsequent\r\ntermination of the dormant portfolio, in adherence to the investment claims\r\nprocedures stipulated by the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasure to confirm your eligibility for this claim, and I express\r\ngratitude for finally locating a family member after an exhaustive search.\r\nIn accordance with the regulations set forth by the Securities and\r\nInvestment Board (SIB) under the Financial Services Act 1986, the immediate\r\npossession of any unclaimed investments exceeding a decade is mandated.\r\nConsequently, unclaimed investments or funds are subject to approval by the\r\nregulatory body for transfer to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\r\nWe have a remaining window of 36 days to complete the termination, claim,\r\nand possession of this investment; failure to do so will result in\r\nforfeiture to the Treasury Authority.\r\n\r\nUpon the successful acquisition of this portfolio and subsequent release of\r\nfunds to your designated bank account, it is proposed that 10% of the funds\r\nbe allocated to charity organizations of your choosing, with 45%\r\napportioned to you and the remaining 45% to myself. Rest assured, all\r\nrequisite documentation supporting this claim is readily available and\r\nshall be furnished upon request throughout the process.\r\n\r\nThe strategies and technicalities of this transaction have been\r\nmeticulously planned, and I anticipate its completion within seven to\r\nfourteen days following receipt of your assent. To initiate the procurement\r\nof documents in your name as the claimant/beneficiary, I kindly request the\r\nprovision of the following information:\r\n\r\n    Full Name:\r\n    Address:\r\n    Direct Mobile Number:\r\n    Occupation:\r\n    Age:\r\n    Place of Birth:\r\n\r\nPlease be assured that this claim will be pursued through legal channels\r\nvia the court, and all actions will be conducted in strict compliance with\r\nthe provisions of the Inheritance Act Claims (Provision for Family and\r\nDependents) Act 1975. This legislation governs statutory provisions in\r\ninstances where there is inadequate provision in the will or under\r\nintestacy law (i.e., when an individual passes away without a will).\r\n\r\nI extend my gratitude for your commitment to maintaining confidentiality\r\nregarding this transaction. Should you have any further inquiries or\r\nconcerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nEdhon Bernasconi (LL.B, LL.M, M.A)"

I'm not very familiar with these legal procedures and terminologies, but I'm trying my best to understand.\n\nIf I understood correctly, Arthur passed away without leaving a will and his estate is now intestate. You're planning to present our case in court and secure several documents like an Affidavit of Claim, Indemnity Letter, etc., correct? \n\nI'm also curious about the total value of the investment that stands at... well, you didn't mention a specific amount. Could you clarify this for me?\n\nYou mentioned something about disbursement on an annual basis for the next decade. How does this work exactly? And what happens after the period of 365 days following the activation of the dormant portfolio?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about the allocation of funds? You mentioned some percentages but didn't specify which amounts they refer to.\n\nLastly, you mentioned that we have a remaining window of certain days to complete the claim. How many days are left exactly?\n\nI apologize if my questions seem basic or naive. As I said earlier, I'm not very familiar with these matters.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAllene"
