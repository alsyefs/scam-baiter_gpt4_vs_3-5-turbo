Could you please tell me more about how this happened? \n\nAs for Mr. Santos William, I'm afraid there seems to be some misunderstanding. I don't recall authorizing anyone to act on my behalf. Could you provide more details about his claim?\n\nI'm also curious about the Allied Investment Bank you mentioned. How did they get involved in this matter? \n\nLastly, I would like to clarify that I am very much alive and well, thank you for your concern though.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
