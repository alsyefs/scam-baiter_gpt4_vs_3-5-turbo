I need your urgent assistance to transfer some funds out of this Bank, the sum amount to $26.6 Million Dollar that has been doormat In our bank for years now. I cannot directly achieve this without the help of a foreigner and that Is why I am contacting you. All documents to enable the smooth release of this fund to you will be carefully worked out and there will be practically no risk involved, this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law as a change of fund ownership certificate In your name will be legally initiated.\nA perfect arrangement Is In place for the release of the fund to you without hitches through Bank transfer. This measure was thought of due to the difficulties In transferring huge funds from one country to another, because of the global fight on illicit movement of funds to sponsor terrorism or the risk of not contacting the ongoing dreaded disease called Covid 19 pandemic and now Omicron. Transferring the fund to you through Bank transfer Is a perfect way or whichever way you wish Is been done In your country.\nNote that all necessary relevant documents for the process of the fund will be taken care of by the both of us. The fund will immediately be transferred into your bank account within a week or two weeks as soon as the document Is done and sent to the appropriate bank department.\nIf you agree to work with me and you are ready to proceed In the process, I want you to state how you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.
