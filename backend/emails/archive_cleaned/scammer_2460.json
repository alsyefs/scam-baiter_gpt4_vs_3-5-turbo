        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite thrilled to hear about this opportunity. However, I have a few questions that I'd like to clarify before we proceed further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has chosen me specifically for this fund release? Also, could you provide more details about the ONLINE BANKING WIRE TRANSFER SYSTEM? How does it work and how secure is it?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned a fee of dollars for opening a new Online Banking Wire Transfer in my name. Could you elaborate on what this fee covers exactly?\n\nLastly, I noticed that you've asked for some personal information such as Full Name, Home Address, Occupation, Cell Tell phone number and Driving License or Passport. While I understand the need for verification in such matters, I am not comfortable sharing these details over email due to security reasons. Is there any other way we can verify my identity without compromising my personal information?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSam"
