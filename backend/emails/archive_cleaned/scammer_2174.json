Before we proceed, could you please provide me with some more details about what this payment is for? I want to make sure I fully understand the situation.\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about how the money gram and Western Union options work? I'm not very familiar with those methods of payment. Thank you!\n\nBest wishes,\nAntoinette"
