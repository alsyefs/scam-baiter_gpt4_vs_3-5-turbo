It's not every day that one hears about an ATM card of a million USD being approved for them. \n\nCould you please tell me more about how this came to be? How was I chosen for this wonderful opportunity? Also, could you provide some details about the delivery process? I'm really curious to know how it works.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nStacey"
