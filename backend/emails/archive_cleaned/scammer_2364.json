However, before I provide any personal information, could you please clarify some details for me?\n\n1. What is the purpose of opening a file? Is it necessary for the funds to be released?\n2. Can you provide more information about the source of these funds?\n3. Are there any fees or charges associated with this process? If so, what are they and how can they be paid?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarvin"
