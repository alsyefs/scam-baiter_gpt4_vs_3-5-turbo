And could you tell me a little more about what these funds are for? \n\nAlso, you mentioned someone at the Rochester Airport. Who is this person and how are they involved in the process?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S. Please note that I can't share my address or phone number online for security reasons.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrisha"
