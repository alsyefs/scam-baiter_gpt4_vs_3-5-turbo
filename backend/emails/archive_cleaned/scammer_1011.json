        "body": "Good Morning Mr. Jay Clayton,\n\nThank you for your detailed email. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about this large sum of money that is apparently linked to my name. However, I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message.\n\nFirstly, who is Mrs. Annette Cang? And why would my funds be transferred into her account? I don't recall having any connection with her.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned something about a fee of $250 for Fund Legality and Bulk Money Transfer Permit. Could you please explain more about what these are and why they are necessary?\n\nLastly, could you provide more information on the Bank of America Accountant Officer Cashier Office where the payment should be sent? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSonja"
