        "body": "The first step requires that you send me your name and address so that the\r\nletter of authority /POA  will be prepared to enable you apply via Bank\r\nMandiri Indonesia where the fund is domiciled\r\n\r\nI appreciate your prompt response. However, for the purpose of the fund,you\r\nwill stand as the Manager then you  will be empowered to follow up and\r\ncoordinate with  Bank Mandiri Indonesia and other related\r\nauthorities/parties to finalize the due payments on the aforestated sum of\r\nmy Late husband’s  Estate to your personal account account which you will\r\npresent to the bank.\r\n\r\nYou will manage the fund and have 25% as your remuneration and invest the\r\n75% into business ventures that will yield interest. My demised husband was\r\nthe one that deposited the fund to the bank before his death.Once the POA\r\nis given,then the MOU and agreement will be sent to you which you are\r\nentitled to read carefully peruse through the Agreement and Memorandum of\r\n Understanding (MOU) and indicate your acceptance or otherwise of\r\nsame…Please note that your amendment and inputs will welcomed at arriving\r\nat a final acceptable version\r\n\r\nThe estate is the deposit with the bank to the tune of USD$ 75,900,000.\r\n\r\nThe first step required that you send your name and address so as to have a\r\ndraft of the POA which will be sent to you for endorsement after proper\r\nreading.The next is the draft of the MOU and agreement which you will still\r\nread and amend before arriving at a final acceptable version\r\n\r\nOnce this is agreed upon then you will contact the bank and forward the POA\r\nand MOU/agreement then they will give you guidelines on how best to receive\r\nthe fund\r\nYou will invest the 75% in a profitable business in your country that will\r\ngenerate profit then from the returns on investment, you help the needy. If\r\nthe fund is not invested,there will not be returns on investment and the\r\nfund will definitely finish at a certain point.\r\n\r\nI am considering hospitals,hotels and estates. I suggest that you should\r\nfigure out in your country what can generate good profit.Have a blessed day\r\nahead.I lucidly informed you that the POA or what we also call the letter\r\nof authority gives you the rights  to stand as the next of kin and you have\r\nthe rights to withdrawal once the process is completed.The POA  is not\r\ncomplicated since .It's something you can read and understand\r\n\r\nThe fact beholds that without the POA or letter of authority,the bank will\r\nnot honour your email upon contact regarding such fund\r\n\r\nThe MOU and agreement is used to outline your duties and specification.The\r\nMOU and agreement is voluminous so it's something you settle down and read\r\ngradually. It cannot be read in a rush\r\n\r\nThese are the first few documents that need to be submitted before the bank\r\nwill respond and give you guidelines.Am not a banker but I know that they\r\nwill ask for the last statement and deposit certificate to confirm that i\r\ngave you the go ahead to receive the fund.\r\n\r\nThe truth has to be told for an understanding / smooth and successful\r\nreceipt of the fund.Some fees / charges will be involved but I don't know\r\nhow much that will be involved.Given my situation and health condition,I\r\nwill be able to use the little fund available for my drugs and hospital\r\nbills to pay for the procurement of the POA and MOU - agreement documents\r\n\r\nAs a managers,you should be versed with business acumen to know the kind of\r\nbusiness that will generate investment returns.I don't know your country or\r\nwhere you are from as such I would not be able to know what business\r\nthrives in your country unless you open up\r\n\r\nThe documents mentioned earlier are  crucial documents that will be\r\nsubmitted before the bank can proceed.\r\n\r\nThe MOU and agreement talks about the terms and Conditions for the\r\nAppointment of the Manager and\r\nAcceptance/Recognition of the Manager, Your roles and duties and conditions\r\nfor acceptance\r\n\r\nFrankly speaking,if an estimate is given say $1 or $20 then I could be\r\nmistaken but the bank will tell you how much the fee will be.\r\n\r\nThe business that would be suitable for investment in any country would be\r\nreal estate and hospital even though am not familiar with your country or\r\nits business and landscape\r\n\r\nI'm not the one preparing the MOU /Agreement but through a lawyer.If you\r\nsend your name and Contact address as requested earlier then ,I believe\r\nthese answers will be under way. That i gave you a hint of what it entails\r\ndoes not mean I am the one processing the legal document so i would not\r\nhave much to say  but request that you send your name and contact details\r\n\r\nIf you send the details,it will forward to the appropriate office where the\r\nPOA and MOU/Agreement will be drafted and sent to you for proofreading.\r\nWhen you receive and proofread that you can indicate your acceptance or\r\notherwise of same…You are not forced or under duress. Its a matter of choice\r\n\r\nYou asked me and I suggested the line of business I feel that could thrive\r\n and it does not mean my suggestion is final.\r\n\r\nHowever,you have not even indicated your country to find out if such\r\nbusiness can be invested in such a country but you only ask questions.\r\n\r\nAll you need do is send me your details\r\n\r\nYour full names and contact address.\r\n\r\n The required details will be sent to the lawyer who will draft the POA\r\n,MOU and agreement.It will be sent to you once it is completed then you\r\nread through it. The reading through it is actually proofreading.\r\n\r\nWhen you receive the draft and after reading through,then you can indicate\r\nyour acceptance or otherwise of same…You are not forced or under duress.\r\nIt's a matter of choice\r\n\r\n>"
