I am pleased to inform you of my success in  the previous transfer of funds in cooperation with the new partner, \nI am currently in Hong Kong now for business investment.\nMeanwhile, I have not forgotten your previous efforts and attempts to  assist me to transfer the Funds, despite the fact that we could not reach a certain conclusion/success.  I am sorry that all this time has passed\nbecause it came at a time when there was so much confusion that I lost interest in you about the deal, but I thank God that it ended today and moved successfully. \nI want you to contact your Piraeus Bank account manager, his name is Mr. Alley Moussa, email address: (\nalleymoussa2@gmail.com\n)\nI instructed him to release your account details to you and send you an ATM card that I deposited in your name and  the card I credited it with the total amount ($1,000.000.00) that I saved for your compensation for all the efforts made and attempts to help me in the past.\nI appreciate your efforts during this time, although it did not work as planned, today I give God all the glory for making everything go successfully. \nSo do not hesitate to contact him, I mean your account manager Mr. Alley Moussa and ask him to release your Piraeus Bank details to you which will enable you have full access into the deposited fund.  Please let me know once you receive the fund so that we can share the joy after all the effort at that time.\nI believe in determination, and I hope this compensation helps to seal the secret we once shared together. \nThanks so much for the past effort, I appreciate it so much.\nYour sincere friend\nEdward Mark"

        "body": "Dear Edward Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope this message finds you well. It's been a while since we last spoke, and I'm glad to hear about your success with the previous transfer of funds. Congratulations!\n\nI remember our previous discussions about assisting you with the fund transfer, and although we couldn't reach a conclusion at that time, I appreciate your acknowledgment of my efforts. It's unfortunate that there was confusion which led to a loss of interest, but I'm glad everything has worked out for you now.\n\nYou mentioned contacting Mr. Alley Moussa, the account manager at Piraeus Bank, to release my account details and send me an ATM card with the deposited funds. That sounds intriguing. Could you please provide more information about how this process works? How long does it usually take for the ATM card to be delivered?\n\nI must admit, I'm curious about the total amount that has been saved for me. Could you give me an estimate? Also, what are the next steps once I receive the fund? Are there any fees or charges involved in accessing the funds?\n\nThank you again for thinking of me and appreciating my past efforts. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nEric"
