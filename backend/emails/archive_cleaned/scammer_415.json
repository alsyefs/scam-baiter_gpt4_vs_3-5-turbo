I must admit, I'm not entirely familiar with how these things work.\n\nCould you please explain more about the origin of these funds? How was I selected as a recipient? Also, could you provide more details about the Remittance and Transfer fee?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in helping me understand this process better.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nGaylord"
