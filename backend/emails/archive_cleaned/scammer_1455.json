        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate you keeping me updated about the payment that is still in your custody. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the transfer paper permit? What exactly is it for and why is there a high bill associated with it?\n\nI'm also curious about the Special Christmas Bonus that you mentioned. How does it work and what are the benefits of availing it?\n\nLastly, could you clarify how the funds will be transferred to my address? Will it be through Western Union or another method?\n\nThank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nTiffany"
