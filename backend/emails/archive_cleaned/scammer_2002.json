        "body": "Hello Mr. Thomas Stanley,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the transfer of my funds. I appreciate your assistance in this matter. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with any payments.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the charges that need to be deducted? What are these charges for?\n\n2. Why is an affidavit and stamp duties required from the high court of Ottawa, Canada? How does this process work?\n\n3. Is there any specific reason why payment needs to be made through gift cards or Bitcoin wallet? Are there alternative payment methods available?\n\nI look forward to your prompt response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
