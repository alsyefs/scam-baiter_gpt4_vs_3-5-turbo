        "body": "Dear Mr. Joshua Ibeh,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the Power of Attorney and the opportunity to claim my part payment. I appreciate your assistance in this matter.\n\nI have a few questions before proceeding. Could you please provide more information about Jordan from the USA? How did he come across my part payment and why does he want to be my business partner? It would be helpful to understand his background and intentions.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify the exact amount of the part payment that Jordan is claiming on my behalf? This will help me better understand the situation.\n\nRegarding the Power of Attorney, what specific powers would I be granting to Jordan if I were to issue it? It's important for me to fully comprehend the implications before making any decisions.\n\nLastly, could you explain why it is necessary for me to send my passport copy and other personal information? I want to ensure that my privacy and security are protected throughout this process.\n\nThank you for your understanding, Mr. Ibeh. I look forward to receiving your response and further guidance on how we can proceed with this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nEric"
