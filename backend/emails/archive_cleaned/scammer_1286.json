It seems like a thorough process.\n\nI have a few follow-up questions regarding the answers you provided. Firstly, could you please clarify what nationality Mr. Whelan Ceron was? Also, could you provide more details about his role as a director with Shell oil Company and his ownership of MAF HOLDINGS UK?\n\nAdditionally, I'm curious to know if there were any specific circumstances surrounding the motor accident that led to Mr. Ceron's unfortunate demise. Was it a single-vehicle accident or involved other parties?\n\nLastly, I would like to inquire about the cash amount mentioned in the bank account. Could you confirm if it is indeed million pounds? That seems like a substantial sum.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance in providing these answers. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarcus"
