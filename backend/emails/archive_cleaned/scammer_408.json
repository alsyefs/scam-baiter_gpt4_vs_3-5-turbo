        "body": "Dear Friend\nIt’s my pleasure to have contact with you based on the critical condition I find myself in, though it's not a financial problem, but my health condition. I am suffering from long term pancreatic cancer and you might have known that cancer is a deadly disease and I don't want my late husband's hard earned money to be wasted without adding value to the people's lives.  Though I don’t know you, and my contact with you was not by mistake, but by divine favor of GOD.\nMy name is Mrs. Christabel Daniel, Switzerland national married to Mr. Leo Daniel, a construction engineer.  We live in the United Kingdom and we were married for the Twenty  Nine Years without a child before he died. He died after a brief illness that lasted for five days. Since his death, I decided not to remarry. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$ 8.2M (Eight Million Two Hundred Thousand Dollars) in the Bank, and the money is currently with the bank.  Recently, My Doctor told me that I don’t have much time to live because of the cancer problem.\nHaving known my condition I decided to search for someone who will use the money for humanitarian work to help the less-privileged people and that is why I am contacting you. I want you to utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want you to take 30 Percent out of the total money for your kind efforts, while 70% of the money will go to charity works and helping the orphanage people. I don’t want my husband’s efforts to be used by the Government and that is the reason I want you to use it for humanity 's work. I grew up as an Orphan and I don’t have anybody as my family member and I know how it is to be an Orphan.  Am doing this so that GOD will forgive my sins and accept my soul because this sickness has suffered me so much.\nAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact details of the bank to enable you to contact the bank and I will send an authority letter that will prove you as the present beneficiary of the money in the bank.  If you assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.\nContact me here EMAIL( \nchristable_daniel@aol.com\n )\nHoping to receive your reply.\nRegards,\nMrs. Mrs. Christabel Daniel,\nI am writing from the London Bridge Hospital,\nAddress 27 Tooley St, London SE1 2PR, UK"

        "body": "Thank you for your kind reply to my email and for accepting to assist me with my charity work plan. I wish you knew me very well. I am an honest and uncomplicated person and I am happy if you are as honest as I am. I don't know you personally and I believe that you are a good person who will use 70% of the money for charity work. My late husband and I lived in the United States before moving to the United Kingdom after my late husband received a large contract in the United Kingdom. I want you to understand my situation and the pain I'm going through and I don't want you to take advantage of that and betray me. Throughout my life I have helped many poor people and donated a lot to the many orphanages and needy.\r\nI hate cheating and lying people and I won't be happy if someone cheats on me because I will never do that to anyone. The total amount to be used for the charity work to support the poor and the orphanage is in the bank in the United States. If you are honest and willing to use the money for charity by helping the poor and orphanage residents, please send me your full name and address and a scanned copy of your ID card, so that I can forward it to the bank. I will tell the bank that you will use the money for charity work to help the poor people with the money, and the bank will fulfill my request immediately. This charity work is a dedicated job and you have to use the money for all areas where people need help and that's why I need an honest person.\r\n\r\nPLEASE REMEMBER THAT AS A SICK PERSON WHO WAS ADMITTED IN THE HOSPITAL, I CAN NOT BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO YOUR EMAIL EVERY DAY. BUT PLEASE KEEP CHECKING UP YOUR EMAIL IN CASE I SEND YOU ANY MESSAGE\r\nHoping to receive your reply.\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely, Mrs. Christabel Daniel"
