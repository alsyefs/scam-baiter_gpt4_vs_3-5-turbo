        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite surprised to hear about this sum of money owed to me by these banks. Could you please explain how this situation came about? How did these three different banks end up owing me such a large amount?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the necessary requirements were that I apparently fulfilled? I don't recall participating in any activities or transactions that would result in this outcome.\n\nI'm also curious about the process of transferring funds. How does your macro transfer system work? Is it secure and reliable?\n\nI appreciate your assistance with my inquiries.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAntoinette"
