It's important to ensure that everything is done legally and transparently.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify why you specifically chose me to assist you with this matter? There might be other individuals or organizations better equipped to handle such transactions.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
