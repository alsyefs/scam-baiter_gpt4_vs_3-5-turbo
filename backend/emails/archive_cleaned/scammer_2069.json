        "body": "I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information that comes by as a result of this mail. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest and great benefit to both of us, I want you to go through this letter thoroughly for better understanding.\nI am Paul Huxford (New Zealand nationality), the Chief Investment Officer, Managing Director at ANZ Investment Management (Auckland, New Zealand) Co. LTD. Branch Address, NO.833 Collins Street Docklands, Melbourne, Australia and I am in charge of all our Investor's Direct Capital Funds, I have more than 208 Corporate Investors attached to my portfolio whose Capital Investment Funds are being managed and administered by me. This Capital Investment Funds has a value of over US$318.2Million net which is used for trading in Stock Market, and Lending with Profit Returns every end of year. Each corporate investor is expected to receive interest from his total Investment Capital Funds per annum on each of the Investment Capital Funds. I make an excess of 1.2% each from all the Investor's Investment Capital Funds annually which have exceeded our targeted 20% of the Total Investment Capital Funds and so far I have secretly made $48.8Million over time from Investorâ€™s Excess Maximum Return Capital Profit (E.M.R.C.P).\nHowever, \nI cannot transfer this fund to myself and hereby seek for a foreigner, who has no trace of contact with me; who would be willing to stand as an Investor to receive these funds as Tenure Investment Proceeds in his/her account. \nI need you (foreigner) to stand as an Investor in order for me to easily transfer the funds to your foreign account as fast as possible. Otherwise if discovered, our establishment will convert the funds into the company's treasury at the end of first quarter and this is where you come in. This is a fair deal without any risk attached on your side, the risk involved in this deal is on my part. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank or completing this deal half way thereby attracting the attention of some officers in my bank.All I require from you is to permit me to put you in as a foreign investor to my Bank and I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will put you in as an Investor to my bank and attach the profit fund to your portfolio in order to speedily facilitate the remittance of the funds out of my bank. I will work with my Lawyer to perfect all arrangements in your favor and the funds will be paid to you for our own use. As a professional, it is my duty to ensure that the transfer is done in a quiet manner, hence you will have to follow my instructions and act accordingly to enable everything to work out smoothly. I will do everything legally required to ensure that the project goes smoothly and it shall pass through all Laws of International Banking.\nMeanwhile, at the successful completion of this project, 45% of the total funds ($48.8Million USD) will be your share profit for your assistance/contributions, while 55 % will be my share. Please if my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. I am the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again! I am a family man; I have a wife and one child. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences are,but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence, if we can be of one accord.\nIf you find yourself able to work with me, do let me know to enable me to provide further details for better understanding on how we can achieve the success of this project together. Get back to me on time if my proposal is of appeal to you after reading through the details. Your swift response (either positive or negative) will be well appreciated.\nI AWAIT YOUR RESPONSE.\nRegards,\nPaul"

        "body": "Hello Paul,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. I must say, it sounds like a very interesting proposition. However, I have a few questions that I would like to clarify before we proceed further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain in simpler terms how this process works? As you might understand, I'm not very familiar with the intricacies of investment banking and financial management.\n\nSecondly, what exactly is my role in this project? You mentioned that I would be standing as an investor. Does this mean that I will need to invest any of my own money?\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about the legal procedures involved? It's important for me to ensure that everything we do is within the bounds of law.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnn"
