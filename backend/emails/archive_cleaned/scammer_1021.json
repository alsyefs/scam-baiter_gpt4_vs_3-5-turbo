        "body": "Hello Wray,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have provided regarding my fund payment. It's quite concerning to hear that I may have been swindled by individuals using various means such as Western Union, Cash App, Zelle, Venmo, Bank Transfer Deposit, and Money Gram.\n\nI'm glad to know that the United Nations UN has taken this matter seriously and held a meeting with the Board of Directors of Western Union, Money Gram, Monetary Fund IMF, FBI, and the Ministry of Finance. It's reassuring to see such collaboration in addressing these scams.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details on how I can proceed with claiming my compensation? You mentioned contacting Mrs. Betsy Holden from Western Union. Should I reach out to her directly? What information should I provide when contacting her?\n\nThank you once again for your assistance in this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nMoira"
