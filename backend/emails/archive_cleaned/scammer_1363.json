I appreciate your diligence in confirming the authorization of any changes to my account.\n\nCould you please provide me with more information about the purpose of their visit? What specific changes are they requesting? It is important for me to understand the details before making any decisions.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify why they would want to divert my funds to another account? Is there a valid reason for this request?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you soon so that we can proceed accordingly.\n\nBest wishes,\nJustin"
