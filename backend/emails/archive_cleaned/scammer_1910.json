        "body": "Hello Mr. Michael Williams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my payment file. I appreciate the update and your assistance in sending the funds through Western Union. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more information about the transfer permit? What exactly is it for and why is it necessary for receiving the payment? Additionally, what is the fee associated with obtaining this permit?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that I can track my MTCN (Money Transfer Control Number) through a link provided. Could you please share that link with me so that I can keep track of my funds?\n\nLastly, you mentioned buying a Card Card or Steam Wallet card. Could you explain further how these cards are related to receiving the payment? What purpose do they serve?\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in clarifying these details.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
