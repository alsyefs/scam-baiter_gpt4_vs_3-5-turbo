        "body": "Hello Mr. Shonubi,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I had no idea that my name and email address were on such a list. It's fascinating how these things work, isn't it? \n\nI must say, I'm not familiar with Mr. John Norbert of Fitch Way, CA USA. I can assure you that I am very much alive and well. How did he come to have power of attorney over my affairs? That's quite puzzling.\n\nYou mentioned an approved fund payment worth MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS. Could you please provide more details about this? Where did the funds originate from?\n\nAlso, could you explain what steps I need to take next in order to secure these funds? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRosa"
