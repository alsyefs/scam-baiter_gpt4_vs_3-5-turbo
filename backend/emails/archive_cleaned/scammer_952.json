I must admit, I don't know much about the oil industry or how these things usually work. Could you maybe explain a bit more about how you came across my contact information? \n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the project that was executed? It sounds fascinating! And what kind of investment plan are we talking about here?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but as I said, this is all very new to me and I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRandall"
