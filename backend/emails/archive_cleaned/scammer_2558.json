        "body": "Hello Mr. Donald J. Richard,\n\nThank you for reaching out and informing me about this situation. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that my name was among the victims of such fraudulent activities.\n\nI appreciate your advice on not dealing with any other banks or entities regarding this matter. It's reassuring to know that US Bank is taking care of this issue.\n\nYou mentioned two methods of receiving the funds - through an ATM Visa Card or Direct Wire Transfer. Could you please elaborate more on these options? How would each process work?\n\nAlso, I noticed you asked for some personal details. While I understand the need for verification, I hope you understand my hesitation in providing such information over email due to security reasons. Is there a secure method through which I can provide these details?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSherry"
