        "body": "Dear Sir,\nI am Mr. Edward Kong, the Vice President and Branch Manager of The Bank of\nEast Asia (USA), Flushing Branch Flushing New York, USA. I write to seek\nyour consent to carry out a transaction that would be highly beneficial to\nyou and me. I know you may be wondering why I am contacting you for this\ndespite all the friends and relations that I have but I decided to do this\nwith an unknown person to avoid any form of blackmail in the future.\nMr. Alvin Peter Kappelmann Jr was an account holder with my bank. I have\nbeen his account officer for 11 years before his death. He died during the\nWorld Trade Centre bombing in September 11 2001.\nSince his death, the management of my bank has made series of efforts to\nlocate his family but all efforts were proved abortive. I also carried out\nseries of research to find his family but it was confirmed that the mother\nwho was the only surviving member of the family died at the hearing of the\nfact; no one was able to claim the fund he deposited in my bank legally\nbecause there was no will to it. He had a secret dollar account with my\nbank worth the sum of $58,200,000.00 (Fifty Eight Million, Two Hundred\nThousand United States Dollars) with an interest agreement of 6.7% which\nhave been for the past 9 years.\n  My purpose of contacting you now is this:\nMy bank during the last executive board meeting resolved that if by the\nend of this year and there is no beneficiary to the said account, the\naccount will be confiscated and the fund sent to the bank treasury and\nthis is where I am interested in and wants you to come in:\nI want you to come in as the Next of Kin/Beneficiary to this account. I\nhave all the titled documents to back your claim and as the Vice President\nand Manager of this branch, it is in my power to carry out any form of\nverification on the beneficiary of the said fund and process the fund wire\nwithout any problem. I want you to know that \nthis is legal and 100% risk\nfree as all the titled documents would be changed to your name and the\nfund wired to any bank account you wish to have it wired to.\nPlease note that I am willing to let you have 40% of the total sum while\nyou give me 60% when the fund finally gets to your nominated bank account.\nAlso note that I am willing to go extra mile to make this a success\nbecause \nif anything goes wrong, then I stand the risk of losing my job and\neven go to jail for trying to carry out such transaction\n.  This is why I\nam contacting you so that we can put heads together and take care of this\ntransaction within the next 9 days.\nKindly get back to me immediately so that I advice you on how this would\nbe carried out.Reply all email to; \nInfo.edkong@gmail.com\nSincerely,\nMr. Edward Kong"
