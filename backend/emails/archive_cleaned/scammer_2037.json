        "body": "Hello Mr. Osborne Michel,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing this information. It's quite interesting to hear about the Unclaimed and Lost Money owned to companies. I'm curious, how does this process usually work? And what kind of issues have been caused by poor Government policies?\n\nI'm also intrigued by the Financial Services scheme Million usd you mentioned. Could you please elaborate more on that? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAsha"
