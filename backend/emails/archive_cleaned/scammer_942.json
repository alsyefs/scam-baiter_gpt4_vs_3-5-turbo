It's not every day that one hears about such a fund payment.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this? How was I selected for this fund payment? And what exactly does it mean to be a 'scam victim attempted scam victim'? \n\nI'm also curious about the role of the British government and European Union in this process. Could you elaborate on their involvement?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nLorraine"
