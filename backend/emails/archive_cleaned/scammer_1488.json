Now that we have an understanding, I would move action\r\nimmediately to adjust our records and have my sources in some strategic\r\ndepartments and offices do the same in their records. This would have your\r\ndata reflected in our records as having carried out a certain work for us,\r\nfor which this 18 million payment is legally owed to you.\r\n\r\nThe status of the $18Million would be regularised to reflect in all files\r\nand records that it is your approved, lawful payment for a certain contract\r\nexecuted for the NAPPM a couple of years back.\r\n\r\nI would have an attorney file in the documents with the CBN for processing\r\nand transfer to your bank account. The bank would immediately process and\r\ntransfer the fund into your account within 3 days.\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in my first email, youâ€™ll keep 30 % as your own bonafide\r\nshare.\r\nThe remaining 70 % is mine though you would get another 10percent in any\r\ninvestments I make under your tutelage.  Yes, I would need you as my front\r\nto invest the fund.\r\n\r\nBelow are the items I require from you, to enable me start the procedure:\r\n\r\n1. Photocopy of your VALID international passport.\r\n\r\n2. Your Full name and address\r\n\r\n3. Your cell phone number for unrestricted access to you.\r\n\r\n4. Your bank account to receive the transfer>>>>>> Account name, your\r\naccount number, Bank name, Bank address, Swift Code, Bank telephone number.\r\n\r\n5. Your Occupation\r\n\r\nThe business is projected to be completed within 10-working days, from the\r\ndate I receive the above listed items from you. Lastly, it is important you\r\ntreat this business as strictly confidential, while I look forward to a\r\nhealthy and lasting business relationship with you.\r\n\r\nI am available for all further questions and explanations you may need.\r\n\r\nDr. Smith Mark"
