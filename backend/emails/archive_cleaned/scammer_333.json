        "body": "  Hello Dear,\nI'm Carey Portman from Altamonte Springs, Florida. \nI have worked in the gold mining sector for more than 30 years. Over these years I have had local mining contracts across 5 countries, namely: Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Kazakhstan and Ghana. \nAm currently working with a gold company in Ghana and my contract will expire by next year.  I privately bought about 240 KG of gold from some local miners here at a cheaper price. I don't want my company to know I own such gold because contractors are prohibited from buying gold from local miners.\n \nSo I want to present you as my partner who bought and owns the gold. All legal documentation will be in your name, then the company would ship the gold to your provided address. After you receive it then I can come over to pick it up. I'm willing to give you 30% of the total 240KG of gold.  All I want from you is honesty and transparency. \n \nIf you're okay with the proposal, then I will get an attorney here to draft an agreement between us. As soon as we sign the agreement, I will give you the contact details of the company so you can contact them and instruct them to make the delivery to your address. All this can be done within 8-10 working days.\n \nNOTE: This is 100% legal business. I bought the gold with my money.  Am only doing it because as a contractor with the company I'm not permitted to buy gold from the local miners.\nThe 240KG of gold is worth around 12.5 Million USD if we sell 1KG for 50,000USD. This is unrefined 23 Karat gold with 99% purity. \n \nIf you need any further clarification, kindly let me know. \nI await your response and readiness to enable us to start the agreement process immediately. \n \nThank You\nCarey Portman.

I must admit, I don't know much about it, but your experience across different countries is impressive.\n\nYour proposal is quite intriguing. However, I have a few questions before we proceed further. Could you please explain why the company prohibits buying gold from local miners? Also, how does the process of transferring legal ownership work?\n\nI'm also curious about the value of unrefined Karat gold. Is its worth always stable or does it fluctuate like other commodities? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTravis"

        "body": "Hello Travis,\r\n\r\n Am glad you got back to me and I appreciate your interest in this business\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nHere are clarifications to your questions:\r\n\r\nA. Company prohibits it's staffs buying from the local miners because the\r\ngovernment restricts that. The government explained that local miners are\r\nnot been taxed or regulated, that's why they sell the gold so cheap. So no\r\ncompany wants to have issues with the government concerning that. The local\r\nminers also believe they own the land,  then manually mine and\r\nharvest their gold, hence the government should not regulate or tax them.\r\n\r\nB. The legal documentation will be done by a lawyer here. The certificate\r\nof Origin, Deposit / ownership certificate and other relevant paperwork\r\nwill be done in your name before the shipping company proceeds with the\r\nshipment to your address.\r\n\r\nC. The value of unrefined gold is not thesame as the market price for\r\nrefined gold. But one good thing is that it does not depreciate in value.\r\nGold never depreciates though it fluctuates as usual.\r\n\r\nI await your response to enable us proceed.\r\n\nBest regards.\r\nCarey Portman"

We will start with the legal documentation\r\nfirst.  I will submit your details to my lawyer to start with the\r\npreliminary documentation and also drafting of the legal agreement.\r\nKindly send the following information to enable the lawyer proceed.\r\n1.
