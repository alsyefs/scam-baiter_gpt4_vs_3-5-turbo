It's really kind of the United States Government to help us victims out like this.\n\nI'm curious though, how did you guys catch the scammer? And how did my email and telephone number end up among the victims?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this STEAM WALLET CARD OR ITUNES CARD payment method? I'm not very familiar with it.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
