        "body": "Hello Mr. Kenny,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the two trunk boxes. It's quite surprising to hear about this, as I wasn't expecting anything of the sort.\n\nI'm curious, how did these boxes end up at John Glenn Columbus Airport? And why are they associated with my name? \n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about the meeting held in the United Nations? What was discussed there that led to this decision?\n\nUnfortunately, I won't be able to come down to your airport due to some personal reasons. However, I am open to using a registered reliable courier delivery company. Could you recommend any?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCleo"
