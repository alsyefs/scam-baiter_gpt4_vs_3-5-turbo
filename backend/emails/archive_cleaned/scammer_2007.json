I appreciate you taking the time to inform me about the reduced fee for receiving my funds.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please provide me with more details about how this process works? Specifically, I would like to know how the ATM card will be delivered to me and what steps I need to take once I receive it. Additionally, could you clarify why the fee needs to be paid through Apple card Bitcoin or Steam wallet card?\n\nI look forward to your response and thank you again for considering me for this opportunity.\n\nBest wishes,\nHeather"
