        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite a lot to take in! I'm thrilled to hear that my funds are now here in the USA and ready to be shipped to my address. \n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that my funds were from two different banks - Bank of Erica and Nat West Bank London. Could you please explain how this came about? I don't recall having any dealings with these banks.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the \"FILE\" of my funds is? You mentioned that it needs to be signed and conveyed down here in the USA. What exactly does this process involve?\n\nLastly, I noticed that there's a fee of USD for the FILE to be signed. Is there any way this fee can be deducted from the funds before they're sent to me? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLydia"
