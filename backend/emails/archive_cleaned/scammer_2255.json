        "body": "  Good Morning,\nI got your details from an online directory and having been motivated by your personal status, I decided to approach you for a possible partnership in a multi-million dollars project in crude oil trading. The company I work for is the Singapore Refining Company Pty Ltd (SRC). We have urgent need for a 2 million barrel supply of NATIONAL OIL COOPERATION OF LIBYA (NOCL) crude oil per month for a total period of 12 month (1 year).Our company vice president Ms. Foo, who is directly in charge of crude oil purchase in our company, has given me the responsibility of looking for a crude oil licensed agent with the NOCL who we can make this purchase possible. This is so because the NOCL does not sale their product directly to the buyers rather, through their approved licensed agents who acts as their sales agent/middle man between them and their buyers.\nMy proposal is this, that we (me and you) work together to get you the NOCL license which will authorize you to be a sales agent for the NOCL and subsequently the middle man between our company and NOCL in our company’s purchase intentions. The NOCL license can be assigned to your name as an individual license operator or to your company name if you have a company owned by you alone registered with your local authorities.I will assist you step by step in the process leading to securing the license from the NOCL and thereafter introduce you to our company for the signing of all the sales agreements with the NOCL. As the license holder, the NOCL will remit the sales commissions to your nominate commission receiving Banking coordinates after our company effects the payment of the cargo to the NOCL being the seller. I will have a take home of 40% of your commissions for my facilitating roles while the remaining 60% commissions goes to you as the license owner.\nPlease note:\nMy intentions to profit from this operation should be kept discrete between the both of us. It's against my work ethics to profiteer from our company’s dealing with NOCL but I have seen this as a good opportunity for me to save enough money against my imminent retirement hence my decision to source for a partner who can work with me in this regard.feel free to ask for clarifications to enable you understand this process further. you can get back to me by my pvt Email: (\nrrtrete@outlook.com\n) (\nin1foisaihtampubolon@outlook.com\n)\nMr.Isaih Tampubolon   "

        "body": "Hello Tampubolon,\n\nThank you for reaching out and considering me for this opportunity. It's quite an interesting proposal, I must say. However, I have a few questions that I'd like to clarify before we proceed further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain more about the process of obtaining the NOCL license? How long does it usually take and what are the requirements?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that the NOCL does not sell their product directly to buyers but through approved licensed agents. Could you provide more details on how this system works?\n\nLastly, regarding the commission structure, could you elaborate on how payments will be made? Will they be monthly or per transaction?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nZona"
