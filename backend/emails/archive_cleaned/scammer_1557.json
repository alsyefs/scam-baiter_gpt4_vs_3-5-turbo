        "body": " Dear Friend,\n(UNCLAIMED EXPENSIVE DIAMOND WRIST WATCHES, GOLD ITEMS & US$ 6,850,000)\nMy name is Luis Martinez, former Safe Deposit Vault Manager at now closed Mossack Fonseca Investment Corporation with offices in Panama, Zurich Switzerland, Paris, Florida, New York USA and London UK.\nDuring my work years at Mossack Fonseca, I supervised many offshore investments and safe deposits for foreign investors who invested and deposited their wealth in secret investments and deposits at Mossack Fonseca Investments and Safe Deposit Corporation.\nOne of the investors that deposited her Diamonds, Gold items and cash deposit of US$6,850,000 in Safe Deposit Vault at Mossack Fonseca has long died in the Caribbean Island of Martinique while on vacation and the Diamonds, Gold and cash she kept with the company for Safe Keep are yet to be claimed because she has passed on and left no contact details of any extended family or representative to claim the Diamonds, Gold and Cash.\nI want to present you to Mossack Fonseca Payment Officials as her Heir Next of Kin Representative so that you can claim these items for us to share it accordingly. I have the original copies of the Safe Deposit Documents which will be required to release the personal items to you as her heir representative to claim them. All I need from you is maximum secrecy and cooperation while I present you as her representative so that we can successfully claim the items since I have the original copies of the safe keeping documents.\nHowever, due to series of issues relating to Tax, Mossack Fonseca was directed by the United States Government and European Union Governments to stop operations and close their offices and ensure that all invested and deposits at the company are processed and paid out to the respective investors or their heir next of kin representatives (where the investor has died). The Corporation Payment Officials and their Bankers, UBS Bank are paying out all funds and deposits as directed.\nThese items will be shipped to your address as soon as we commence the claim process because I have the original copies of the Deposit Documents which they will require to approve and process the claim.\nYou can read more about Mossack Fonseca via below links:\nhttps:/ /www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers/new-panama-papers-leak-reveals-mossack-fonsecas-chaotic-scramble/\nList of people named in the Panama Papers - Panama Papers\n \nI shall give you further details as you reply.\nI therefore await your reply to enable us to commence the claim process.\nRegards,\nLuis Martinez    "

        "body": "Hello Luis Martinez,\n\nWow, this is quite a story! I'm sorry to hear about the lady who passed away in Martinique. It's always sad when someone leaves us unexpectedly. \n\nI'm curious though, how did you find me? And why do you think I would be a good fit for this role as her heir? Also, could you tell me more about Mossack Fonseca and its operations?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
