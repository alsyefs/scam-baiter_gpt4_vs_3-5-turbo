        "body": "Hello Hon. Richard R. Taylor,\n\nThank you for your detailed email regarding the ATM card. It's quite exciting to hear about this opportunity! I have a few questions though, if you don't mind.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain more about how this ATM card works? How is it possible to withdraw such a large amount of money from any ATM around the world?\n\nSecondly, I noticed that there are different delivery options with varying costs. Could you provide more details on these options? What does each class entail and what are their respective costs?\n\nLastly, I'm curious about the payment methods for the delivery charges. You mentioned Money Gram, Western Union and gift cards - could you elaborate on how these work?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
