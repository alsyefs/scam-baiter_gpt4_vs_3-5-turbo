It's quite interesting to hear about the Bankers Draft BD MTN and its potential uses in PPP Trading. I must admit, I'm not entirely familiar with these terms. Could you perhaps explain a bit more about what they mean? \n\nAlso, could you elaborate on how the lease bg sblc instrument works? I'm always eager to learn more about these kinds of things.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTrinidad"
