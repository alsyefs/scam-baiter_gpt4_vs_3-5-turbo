I'm thinking of moving because now I'm a wealthy woman, I was one of the scam victims who participated in the Fraud Compensation Awards Program in the United States and Europe many years ago and they refused to pay me. I paid over $32,500 to a scammer while in the USA. to buy it all for the benefit so I decided to travel to Avellino, Italy with all the compensation documents and I was told to contact Lawyer Advocate Carlo Palermo, a member of the Fraud Compensation Awards Program, I contacted him through Email and he explained every detail to me. He said whoever contacted me now is a fake Pretend, he's the only one assigned to compensate me.\nHe took me to the bank to claim my compensation money, right now I am the happiest woman in the world because I have received $2,500,000.00 in compensation (Two Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars). In addition, Barrister Carlo Palermo shows all the information and a list of those who have not been paid and I saw your name and email address as one of the benefactors. This is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those scammers. They don't have your money. They are just extorting money from you by trickery. I would advise you to contact Barrister Carlo Palermo now for assistance. You must contact him directly through the personal email address below.\nAttorney: Carlo Palermo\nEmail Address: \ncp382661@gmail.com\nYou must stop dealing with scammers who contact you by email and phone saying that your money is with them. It's all lies and tricks that they only take advantage of you and they will continue to steal your money until you have nothing to show.\nThe only money I paid after meeting Barrister Carlo Palermo is â‚¬350.\n This is for documenting and working paperwork only please note that stop contacting scammers online or via email again. I suggest you contact Barrister Carlo Palermo, he will help you transfer the winnings $2,500,000.00 in compensation (Two Million and Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) to your bank account. Please stop dealing with those scammers all they do is ask for more and more money to complete your transaction which are all deceitful lies\nBest Regards\nMrs Megan Balmer\nAddress: 2202 Woodlands Pkwy Clive, IA 50325, USA."
