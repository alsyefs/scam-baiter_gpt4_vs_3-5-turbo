It was discovered that your name, identity, and email were currently used to transfer and invest the total sum of $51,000,000.00(Fifty One Million United States Dollars) in the Settlement Bank of United States and the dividend currently running up to $300,000.00 (Three Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which is a total of $51,300,000.00( Fifty One Million, three thousand United States Dollars)We have all the document here to confirm this claim.\nNow the questions are, how can a dead man be actively involved in fund investment without the presence of the next of kin who is supposed to be the signatory?  Secondly, could this lawyer be trying to play a smart one? and lastly but not the least, This office has not at any time been notified either by email or letter by any medical practitioner certifying your deceased state or any document issued by any member of your family or from a registrar of vital statistics that declares the date, location, and cause of your death.\nWe have tried severally to reach-out to you by sending emails to your address and several attempted calls made, but all have so far proved abortive, hence this office is left with no other option than to send this reminder message to your email ones again, as we would not accept to be held liable for any loss of your rights and fund to a wrong person. If you are still alive, do respond with your form of identification for final confirmation without delays, as we have already informed the bank that the real beneficiary of the fund may likely still be alive without even realizing what the lawyer whom so much was entrusted to have been up to.\nMr. JÃ¼rgen Stock,\nNew Secretary-General of the International\nCriminal Police Organization (INTERPOL)\nINTERPOL (General Secretariat)   "

        "body": "Hello Mr. Stock,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must say, it's quite a shock to hear that someone is claiming I'm deceased! I can assure you, I am very much alive and well.\n\nI'm curious about the details of this situation. How did my name and identity get involved in such a large fund investment? And who is this lawyer that's making these claims?\n\nI appreciate your efforts in trying to contact me earlier. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any emails or calls from your office before now.\n\nWhat should be my next steps in resolving this issue? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLionel"
