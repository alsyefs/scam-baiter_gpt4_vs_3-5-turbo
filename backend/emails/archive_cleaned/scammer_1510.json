        "body": "Hello Mr. David Dokholyan,\n\nThank you for reaching out and considering me for this exciting opportunity. It's great to hear about Mr. Alexander Putilov's interest in investing in different sectors.\n\nI'm curious, could you provide more details about the Fund Injection PFI? What does it entail exactly? Also, I'd like to understand better the terms of the loan and what 'terminal season' means in this context.\n\nYou mentioned that the investment Portfolio criterion does not support Joint Venture JV or Equity Share ES but encourages only outright capital investment. Could you elaborate on why this is so?\n\nAs for presenting viable areas for investment, I would need some time to consider and research potential sectors that might be beneficial for both parties involved.\n\nRegarding the live meeting with your Brokers Bankers, could you give me more information about what this meeting would involve? Would it be possible to have an initial virtual meeting due to current global circumstances?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nHerb"
