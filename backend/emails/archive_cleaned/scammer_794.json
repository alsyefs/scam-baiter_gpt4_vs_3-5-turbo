I appreciate the information you have shared with me regarding the release of funds in my name. However, I must clarify that I have not been involved in any motor accident and I am indeed alive.\n\nTo proceed further, could you please provide more details about the monetary fund IMF and how my name was selected? Additionally, I would like to know what steps need to be taken to receive the funds via wire transfer or ATM online.\n\nI understand that you require some personal information from me, but before sharing those details, could you please explain why they are necessary for the process? Also, is there any documentation or paperwork that needs to be completed?\n\nThank you for your assistance. I look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRalph"
