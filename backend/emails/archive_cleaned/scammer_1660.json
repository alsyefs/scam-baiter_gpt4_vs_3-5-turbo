Could you please explain a bit more about how this BTC Binary Code works? And how does the conversion from USD to Bitcoin happen?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)? What is their role in this process? \n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nLynne"
