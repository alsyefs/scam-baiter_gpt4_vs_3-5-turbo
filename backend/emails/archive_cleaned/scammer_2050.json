        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the return of my ATM card. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the wrong address provided by Mrs. Rosemary Stuart Blum. It's quite surprising to hear that someone is claiming that I am deceased and has entered into an agreement with them on my behalf.\n\nTo clarify, I have not signed any Deed of Assignment in favor of Mrs. Rosemary Stuart Blum or anyone else. I am very much alive and would like to proceed with receiving my ATM card.\n\nHowever, before providing any personal information, I would appreciate it if you could confirm some details for me. Could you please provide more information about the Pacific Courier Services? How can I be sure that this is a legitimate service? Also, what is the purpose of the code \"PACIFIC XXL\" mentioned in your email?\n\nBest wishes,\nSharon"
