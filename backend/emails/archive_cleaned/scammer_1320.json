        "body": "Hello there,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I can't believe my email was found in one of those files. It's such a relief to know that these individuals are now in custody and will face justice soon.\n\nI'm curious about the process though. How did you manage to track down these individuals? And how were you able to recover the funds? \n\nAlso, I'm not very familiar with ATM Visa cards. Could you explain how they work? Is it safe and secure?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nCary"
