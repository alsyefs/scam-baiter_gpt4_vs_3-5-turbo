        "body": "  Dear Beloved Friend\nRE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND\nAfter waiting to hear from you or your Ghana partner for a long time now, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution in other not to let it be if I have anything in mind against you. I do not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one problem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.\nSome time ago, your Ghanaian friends, I mean the people that introduced you to the project approached me through my dear wife who work with the Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them conclude a money transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them by removing the original contractor’s name, company’s name and bank particulars from the Bank Of Ghana vetting computer and replacing them with your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the rightful beneficiary of this fund.\nI agreed on condition that they will pay me US$100,000.00 as soon as your name appears as the beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you promised to send money to me.\nDo you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from them and have not set my eyes on any of them?  Based on their attitude, I decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied of my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my job..  Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute any contract in Ghana, although I am the only person privileged to know this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude this project. Now I am ready to forget the past.\nI do not need the US $100.000.00 any longer from you but a good compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them is aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money unnecessarily to Bank of Ghana Officers both here and overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did the work at the beginning and only I can perform it. Finally,\nI need your promise that no official of the Bank of Ghana will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my compensation will be lodged.  Also a TT FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS will be sent to you for endorsement after which I will remit the money within 48 hours.\nI am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with me, kindly contact me on my mail so that we can have a chat over this issue once and for all.  But if the reverse is the case, do not bother yourself to reach me and forget about this money.   "

        "body": "Dear Beloved Friend,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must admit, it is quite surprising to hear about the situation regarding my Ghanaian friends and the fund transfer deal. I had no idea that they approached you or made any arrangements on my behalf.\n\nI understand your concerns about the payment being stopped or encountering problems in the past. It's unfortunate that you haven't received any payment from them yet, despite their promises. I can assure you that I had no knowledge of their intentions or any promises made regarding sending money to you.\n\nI appreciate your willingness to forget the past and move forward with this project. However, I would like some clarification on a few points before proceeding. Firstly, could you please explain why my name needs to be replaced with the original contractor's name in order for the fund release to proceed? Secondly, what is the source of these funds if I haven't executed any contracts in Ghana?\n\nRegarding your request for assurance that none of your colleagues at the Bank of Ghana will be aware of our arrangement, I completely understand your concern given your position. Rest assured that I value confidentiality and will ensure that our communication remains discreet.\n\nAs for compensating you and assisting your wife in establishing a foreign account, I would need more details on how exactly this would work and what is expected from me.\n\nPlease provide me with further information so that we can discuss this matter further. Thank you.\n\nBest wishes,\nWendell"
