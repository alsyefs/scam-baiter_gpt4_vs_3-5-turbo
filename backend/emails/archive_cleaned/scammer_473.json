However, I must clarify that I have not authorized anyone named MR. HANS to receive my funds on my behalf.\n\nI am sorry to hear about the misinformation you received regarding an auto accident involving me and my family. Rest assured, there has been no such incident, and we are all in good health.\n\nTo confirm, I have not changed my bank account details. The bank account information you mentioned does not belong to me. My current bank account details remain the same as previously provided.\n\nPlease let me know what further steps need to be taken to ensure the correct payment is made into my account. I would appreciate it if you could provide more information about the process and any necessary documentation required.\n\nThank you for your assistance in this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nRaymond"
