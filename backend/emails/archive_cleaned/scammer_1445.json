        "body": "Hello Larry Joe,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite exciting to hear about this contract payment! I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain more about the deduction fee? Why is it necessary and what exactly does it cover?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the process of obtaining an affidavit and stamp duties from the High Court of Nigeria? I'm not very familiar with these legal procedures.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
