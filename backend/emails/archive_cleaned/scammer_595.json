        "body": "Hello Chief Justice Harrison Musa,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I apologize for not responding earlier, as I have been quite busy lately. I appreciate you informing me about the claim of my dollars that are in my name. However, I'm a bit confused about the mention of a letter to release an ATM card and the involvement of Diplomat James Lewis.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did my name come up in relation to these funds? And why is there a need for a next of kin to claim the fund? I would like to understand the process better before proceeding.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"nearest color\" in your message? It seems like there might be some confusion or missing information there.\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed.\n\nBest wishes,\nFreida"
