I'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate incident involving Khaled Faraj Mansour and the funds he had deposited with the commercial bank. It must be a difficult situation for his family.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could provide me with more details on how I can assist in claiming the funds on behalf of Mr. Mansour's next of kin. Could you please explain the process and any necessary documentation that would be required? Additionally, I would like to know more about Lincom and its involvement in this matter.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
