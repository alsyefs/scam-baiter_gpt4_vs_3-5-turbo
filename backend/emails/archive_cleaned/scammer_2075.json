        "body": "Hello Andrew Wilson,\n\nThank you for your email. It's quite exciting to hear about the ATM DEBIT CARD. I must say, this is all very new to me. Could you please explain a bit more about how this works? \n\nAlso, could you provide some more details about the documents that will be delivered with the card? What exactly does 'Origin of Fund Paperwork' and 'Certificate of Ownership' mean?\n\nI'm also curious about the delivery process. How can I ensure that it will reach me safely? And what happens if I'm not at home when the delivery arrives?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nTammy"
