        "body": "Hello Mr. Murphy Richard Joseph,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my fund account upgrade charges and the transfer of my contract fund. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring the safety and legitimacy of this transaction.\n\nI understand the need for security measures, and I would like to proceed with authorizing the bank to release and transfer my funds to Mr. Brown Donald. However, before I provide any personal information or copies of my passport ID, could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\n1. How did Mr. Brown Donald become involved in this process? Is he affiliated with the bank or any other official institution?\n2. Can you explain why it is necessary for me to authorize the transfer directly to Mr. Brown Donald's personal bank account in Russia? Are there any alternative options available?\n3. What steps have been taken by the FBI to ensure that my funds will not be diverted or misused during this transfer process?\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused by these questions, but I want to make sure that everything is legitimate and secure before proceeding further.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nLynn"
