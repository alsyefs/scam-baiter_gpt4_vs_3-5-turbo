That was how you were\r\nemailed.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it will please me now that I am still alive to see you use\r\nThese little funds of mine to do charity work on my behalf, reach out\r\nthe poor in the society, with that I believe my God will be happy with\r\nme, that is the only way you can help me .

        "body": "Hello Mrs. Juliana Patrick,\n\nI'm truly touched by your message and the strength you're showing in such a difficult time. It's admirable that even in this situation, you're thinking about helping others. I must say, it's quite a coincidence that my name came up first in your search. \n\nI'm just an ordinary person with a simple job and lifestyle. I don't have any professional experience in charity work, but I've always believed in helping others whenever possible. I've participated in local community service activities and believe that every little bit helps.\n\nHowever, I must clarify that while I am willing to help, I cannot provide personal details like pictures or IDs over the internet due to privacy concerns. But rest assured, my intentions are genuine and sincere.\n\nCould you please share more about the kind of charity work you want me to do? Are there any specific causes or communities you want me to focus on? Also, could you tell me more about Barrister? How will he guide me through this process?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nErnest"
