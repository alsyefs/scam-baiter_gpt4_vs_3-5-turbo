        "body": "Dear Dyer, \n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the review of my payment file. I appreciate your efforts in releasing the pending funds. Could you please provide more information about the partial financial bond and how it will be converted into cash? \n\nI understand that I need to pay a deposit fee, but could you clarify what this fee is for and how much it would be? Additionally, what proof and evidence of payment do I need to submit to your office? \n\nI currently do not have a European bank account. Can you explain why every credit outside Europe would attract extra charges and expenses? \n\nOnce I provide the evidence of payment and receive the fast credit deposit, how long will it take for me to access the cash in my account? \n\nLastly, could you please provide me with the authorized receiving account details so that I can proceed with providing my bank information?\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nPaul"
