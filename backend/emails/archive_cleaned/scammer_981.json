It's quite interesting to hear about the procedures and guidelines that govern your operations, especially with the involvement of such esteemed bodies like the American Government Department Of Treasury, The United Nations, Security Monitoring and the IMF.\n\nI'm curious though, could you explain a bit more about how these anti-terrorist agents operate? It sounds quite alarming that they are looking for government and individual funds to sponsor their activities.\n\nAlso, I'd love to understand more about this process involving the Federal High Court Of Nigeria and the Ministry of Finance. How does an attorney standing on my behalf work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRandy"
