        "body": "Hello Mr. Leon Cillian,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the situation. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that my name and identity have been used in relation to a fund of such a large amount.\n\nI'm curious, how did you come across my email address? And could you please explain more about this United Nation Tag Number? What is its purpose and why is it necessary for the funds to be released?\n\nAlso, I'd like to know more about the All Citizens Bank Trust in New York. Is there any specific reason why this bank has been chosen for the payment?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonald"
