I appreciate you informing me about the fax received from Ms. Tatyana regarding my health and her claim to be authorized to receive a large sum of money on my behalf.\n\nI must admit that I am a bit confused as I do not recall authorizing anyone to handle such matters for me. Could you please provide more details about the nature of this transaction? How did Ms. Tatyana come to be involved, and what is the purpose of the Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know more about the statutory fee that she mentioned. What is it for, and why is it necessary? It would be helpful if you could explain the process and any legal requirements associated with releasing these funds.\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience caused by my delayed response, but I assure you that I take matters like these seriously. Please provide further information so that we can proceed accordingly.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
