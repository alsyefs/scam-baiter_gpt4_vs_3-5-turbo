It must be a challenging time for all those involved.\n\nI'm intrigued by the information you've shared, especially considering his involvement in the world's largest exchange and oil industry. Could you please share more details about this? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"if you trade with\"? Are there specific trading requirements or conditions that need to be met?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nClara"
