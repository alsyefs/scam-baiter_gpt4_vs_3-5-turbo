In any case, I will contact you again in connection with our previous transaction, which was not successful for you. Sorry, your partnership with me cannot complete the funds transfer. I donâ€™t know, maybe because of the strong pressure you have to put up with your interest in the deal.\nIn any case, I am pleased to inform you of my success in receiving funds transferred by a new partner from Venezuela. I am currently in Venezuela for investment. However, I did not forget my previous efforts and tried to help me with the transfer of the fund, despite the fact that we could not come to a concrete conclusion. Thanks to my efforts to help me, my new partner and I decided to compensate you 850,000.00 euros so that you can enjoy joy and happiness with us.\nI left your compensation visa with my secretary to help me send it. Now contact my secretary in Togo, her name is Mrs. Alifah Moumudun and her email address is (\nalifahmoumudun278@gmail.com\n). Tell her to send you a $ 850,000 Visa ATM card. I am currently very busy in Venezuela due to the investment projects I have with my new partner. Rather contact Alifah Moumudun, tell her where to send the compensation visa. The card will be sent to you immediately. I wish you the best in all your endeavors.\nYours sincerely\nWilson Jacob."
