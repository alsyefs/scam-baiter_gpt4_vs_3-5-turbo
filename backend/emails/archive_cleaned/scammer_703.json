        "body": "Hello Mr. Ibrahim Mustafa Magu,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm surprised to hear about this situation with Mr. Kingsley and the draft of four million five hundred thousand US dollars. I must admit, I don't recall having any dealings with a Mr. Kingsley.\n\nCould you please provide more details about how my name was mentioned in this case? And what exactly is the role of Allahgi Suleiman, the deputy governor of central bank in this matter?\n\nI appreciate your efforts in maintaining internet safety and preventing fraud across Africa.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKevin"
