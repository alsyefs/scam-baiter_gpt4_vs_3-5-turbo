However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the contract and how it came about?\n2. What is the total amount of funds that are being released to me?\n3. How did President Bola Ahmed Tinubu GCFR approve my payment? Is there any documentation or proof of this?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSarah"
