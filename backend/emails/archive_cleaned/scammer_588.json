        "body": "Hello Rev Timothy Johnson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected surprise! I'm a bit overwhelmed by the amount mentioned. \n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. How was my email address selected for this lottery? And could you please explain more about the role of the Royal Bank of Canada in this process?\n\nAlso, I'm not very familiar with Apple cards. Could you guide me on how to purchase them and where they are available?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
