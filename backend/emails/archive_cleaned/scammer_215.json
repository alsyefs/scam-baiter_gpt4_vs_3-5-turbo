        "body": "Hello Dr. Olayemi Michael Cardoso,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I must say, it's quite a lot to take in at once! It seems like there's a lot going on and I'm trying my best to understand everything.\n\nFrom what I gather, there is some sort of payment that needs to be made on my end for the transfer of funds into my bank account. Could you please clarify what this payment is for? And why is it necessary?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a bond on the fund. Could you explain more about this? What does it mean when a fund is bonded for security reasons?\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSarah"
