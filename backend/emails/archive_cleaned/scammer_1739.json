        "body": "Hello Mr. Ken Getz,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me about this matter. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear about these overdue funds. Could you please provide more information on this? For instance, how did this situation come about and what is the exact amount of the overdue payment?\n\nI'm also curious as to why the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is involved in this process. Is it common for them to handle such matters? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nPatricia"
