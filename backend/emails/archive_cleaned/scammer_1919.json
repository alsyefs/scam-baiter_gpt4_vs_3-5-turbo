It's not every day that one gets such good news.\n\nI'm a bit confused though, could you please explain why there is a fee involved? And why specifically Steam Wallet Card or Apple Card? I thought postal services usually charge directly for their services.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
