        "body": "Hello JEFF JOHNSON,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I'm thrilled to hear about the interests generated from my funds. However, I must admit that I'm a bit confused about the process.\n\nCould you please clarify what these legal documents are? And why do we need them for the transfer? Also, could you explain more about this 'EUROPEAN UNIONS CLEARANCE FUNDS'? \n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSandra"
