        "body": "Hello Mr. Harry Alex,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information. It's quite surprising to hear about these funds, as I wasn't aware of any unpaid amounts in my name.\n\nI'm interested in understanding more about this situation. Could you please explain how these funds came to be associated with my name? And what is the process involved in claiming them?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a fee that needs to be paid. Could you provide more details on what this fee is for and why it's necessary?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDave"
