        "body": "  Hello,\nAfter a serious thought, i decided to reach you directly and\npersonally because i do not have anything against you, but your\nNigerian partners. I am a Director in charge of Wire Transfer/Telex\nSection at the central bank of Nigeria, Sometime in the past your\nNigerian partners approached me through a friend of mine who works\nwith one of the ministries here and requested that i assist them\nconclude a money transfer deal, they told me to help program the\ntransfer to you.\nAccording to them, they wanted to use this strategy to transfer a huge\nAmount of United States dollars fifteen million dollars($15M), the\nmoney has been floating in the CBN suspense account since then. we\nagreed that once i do this, they would give me $USD100,000.00 and give\nme another $USD100,000.00 when i release the fund to your account.\nWhen they saw that i have programmed it and your name has been\napproved among the list of those to be paid, instead of giving me the\nagreed deposit of us$100,000.00, they started avoiding me and resorted\nto threats. I immediately deleted the transfer code of the fund, which\nis only known to me because of my position, and released other\ncontractorsâ€™ fund and inheritance payments without yours. They became\nangry.  When they saw that their threat did not work, they started\nbribing other officials to get another approval to transfer the money\nto you without success. i want you to know that i am 100% responsible\nfor the delay and obstructions because of their breach of trust.\nIf you doubt what i have just told you, then consider what has\ntranspired through out your claim process, they continue to ask you to\npay money after money and at the end no result and they still tell you\nto pay another fee without any result yet, they are simply wicked. Now\nif you want us to work together, these are my conditions.\n1. I will have 20% of the money because it is only the two of us left for now.\n2. You will assist my son to open an account in your country where i\nwill pay in my own share.\n3. It will be useless and mere waste of time and money if you continue\nwith any other person, so we will conclude this transaction with\nutmost secrecy.\n4. You will provide me with your private telephone, mobile and a\nprivate email to facilitate easy communication between you and I only.\nIf these conditions are acceptable to you, contact me as soon as\npossible to let us finalize, so that the funds can be released to your\naccount after due protocols has been observed. But if you are not\ninterested, i advice you to forget the fund and stop wasting your time\nwith your so called partners in paying endless fees.\nPlease reply via \ndrjosephokwunnanna1998@gmail.com\nBest Regards,\nDr Joseph Okwu\nDirector, Wire Transfer/Telex Dept.\nDeputy CBN Governor\nCentral Bank Of Nigeria   "

        "body": "Hello Dr. Joseph Okwu,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. It's quite a story, I must say! \n\nI'm curious about a few things though. How did my Nigerian partners get in touch with you initially? And why did they choose me for this transfer? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the CBN suspense account? What is it exactly and how does it work?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLance"
