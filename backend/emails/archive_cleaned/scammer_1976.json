It's not every day that one gets such news.\n\nI do have a few questions, though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about how this fund came to be due to me? Also, could you provide more details on the ATM card delivery process?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRyan"
