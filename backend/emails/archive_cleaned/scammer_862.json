        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my abandoned fund. I appreciate the information you have provided. Can you please clarify how exactly the United States Government has ordered the release of my funds from the ERICAN FIRST CREDIT UNION BANK? Is there any documentation or proof that I can review?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to understand why there is a need for me to pay a fee for Fund Legality and Transfer Permit. Can you explain what this fee covers and why it is necessary?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSteve"
