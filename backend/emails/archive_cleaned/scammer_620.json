        "body": "Hello Phillips Williams,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. It's quite an interesting proposition you have there. I'm a bit curious about the details though, could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, I'd like to understand more about the project itself. What exactly does it entail? And what would my role be in all of this?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that no upfront fee is required from me, which is reassuring. However, I'm not entirely clear on how the money will be transferred. Could you explain a bit more about the process?\n\nLastly, it's great to hear that you're planning to retire in my city! It's a wonderful place. Do you already have some properties in mind or are you still looking?\n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBlanca"
