I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain more about this Scam Victim Fund? How was it established by the United Nations?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about forwarding my full details. Could you clarify what specific information you need? I just want to make sure everything is clear before we proceed.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
