        "body": "Hello Henry Pages,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe my luck. I'm so grateful to Mrs. Kelly Craft for her help in this matter. \n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind me asking. Could you please explain more about the options available for receiving the funds? What exactly does each option entail?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the APPLE GIFT CARD means in relation to each option? Is it some sort of payment method or something else?\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about the Funds Release Order fee? How much is it and how should it be paid?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJustine"
