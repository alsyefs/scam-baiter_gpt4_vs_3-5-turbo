The grace period or Moratorium as it is\r\ncalled, is the period you will be allowed to carry out your investment\r\nwithout repayment of the loan. After the expiration of this period you will\r\nstart paying the loan. I have equally explained this before. I don't know\r\nwhy you are going back and forth. Is it that you don't digest my email very\r\nwell? I can't be repeating myself all the time. This is unethical and\r\nunprofessional. The review period is a maximum of 5days. Note that our\r\ncriteria is political and economic stability of the country where the\r\nproject is located and it must have a good return on investment.\r\n\r\nThere is not much difference in the traditional loan structure. The\r\nvariation is a simple application to let the investors know you will be\r\npaying your loan before the due date. Very simple matter. What the investor\r\nis interested in, is paying the loan as at when due or before the due date.\r\nInvestors don't need a defaulter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestor ensuring his investment is protected is very simple. The loan\r\nagreement takes care of this. The loan agreement protects both the investor\r\nand the borrower. If you are interested in the loan, follow the procedures\r\nand wait for the loan agreement, every detail is there. The investor is not\r\nfoolish to throw his money away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot give you time that is convenient for me for the call because I\r\ndon't know the country you are domiciled.

I have told you I am ready to receive any information regarding\r\nthe online business. Go ahead and explain to me what you want me to do to\r\nearn money from home. I embrace the ideal because it is good but it seems\r\nyou are beating around the bush about it. I do not have any particular\r\nbusiness in mind but the one you already have in mind to share with me.\r\n\r\nFinally, I wish to let you know that I have no patience for situations like\r\nthis but the only reason I keep the communication going is because of your\r\nlevel of intellect. You are very sound and you asked intelligent questions.\r\nPlease don't give me hope where there is no hope. We can still remain good\r\nfriends. God has a reason for everything.\r\n\r\nHave a great weekend and God bless\nBest regards\r\nPaul"
