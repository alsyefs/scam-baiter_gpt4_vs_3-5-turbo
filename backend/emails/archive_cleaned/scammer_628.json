        "body": "Hello Dr. Abraham Olofin,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your job as a Chartered Accountant and Forensic Auditor sounds very interesting! \n\nI'm sorry to hear about the passing of ABBA KYARI. It's always sad when someone passes away unexpectedly.\n\nYou mentioned that there is a large amount of money in foreign currency involved. Could you please provide more details about this? How did it come to be in the possession of Mr. Kyari?\n\nAlso, could you explain what you mean by me being part of the fund upon my approval? What exactly would this entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMerle"
