        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the release of my funds. I appreciate your assistance in this matter. I would like to know more about the options you mentioned for receiving the funds.\n\n1. Could you please provide more details about the transfer wire option? How long does it usually take for the funds to be transferred? Are there any fees associated with this method?\n\n2. For box delivery, how secure is this method? Will the package be insured and tracked during transit? Also, what are the estimated delivery times and costs involved?\n\n3. Lastly, could you explain how the ATM credit card delivery works? Is there a limit on how much can be withdrawn from the card at once? Are there any additional charges or fees for using this method?\n\nI look forward to your response so that I can make an informed decision on how to proceed with receiving my funds.\n\nBest wishes,\nNathan"
