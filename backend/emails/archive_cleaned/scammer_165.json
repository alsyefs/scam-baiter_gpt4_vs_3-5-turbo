But I won't forget our friendship and your past efforts, plus the GOOD LUCK that brought me success.\n \nTherefore I want to use this medium to appreciate your earlier assistance and prayers that made way for my success and thanks for being there at the right time. I am obliged to inform you that I succeeded in completing the deal and receiving the total payment of $26,691,464.00 (Twenty Six Million, Six Hundred And Ninety One Thousand, Four Hundred and Sixty Four dollars) which part of it is my 10% commission from the Dubai/Texas oil business with the help of the new partner from Lisbon Capital of Portugal and part of this money is from my 10% commission from the Dubai/ Texas oil business which you are supposed to receive but was finally done under the name of the new partner, while the remaining is from my other share with Bain capital Investment, all the money was converted to Bain capital Investment share and was finally sold by the company.\n \nEverything was perfectly done because we struck a deal with the admin of Bain Capital Investment International, who rendered a tremendous help to us. In appreciation of your help and for old time friendship sake, I decided to will and compensate you with the total sum of US$840,000.00 (Eight Hundred And Forty Thousand United States Dollars) through ATM Master Card, which can be withdrawn from ATM Logo Machine worldwide and it's is from my own share.\n \nNow \ncontact the ATM Processing Unit Uganda\n, whom I handed over the ATM Master Card worth of US$840,000.00 on your behalf to and his name is Mr. Kenneth Ward and his email address is: ( \natmprocessingunit0123@gmail.com\n ) \nwith your personal information\n and ask him to send you the ATM Card worth of US$840,000.00 that I kept for you under his care before I left the country for my treatment. So please feel free to contact Mr. Kenneth Ward with your information where to send your ATM Master card.\n \nAnd remember to keep me posted immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the sufferers at that time and remember that I forwarded instructions to Mr. Kenneth Ward on your behalf to ensure that you receive the ATM Master Card, so feel free to contact him with your personal information for him to send the money via ATM Card to you.\n \nRegards,\nMr. Steven Nelson."

It's been a while indeed since we last communicated, but I do remember our past interactions.\n\nIt's great to hear about your success in the Dubai Texas oil business and with Bain Capital Investment. That sounds like quite an accomplishment! \n\nYou mentioned something about an ATM Master Card worth US Eight Hundred And Forty Thousand United States Dollars that you've kept for me under the care of Mr. Kenneth Ward in Uganda. Could you please tell me more about this? How did this come about?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKasi"
