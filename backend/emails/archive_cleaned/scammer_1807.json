I am quite surprised to receive such an email, but I must say it's a pleasant surprise indeed. \n\nIt's interesting to hear about the General meeting of the United Nations and the IMF countries. Could you tell me more about what was discussed during this meeting? Also, how did my name come up in the discussion?\n\nYou mentioned that I have been authorized to receive a certain amount of money. That sounds wonderful, but could you please explain why I have been chosen for this?\n\nI appreciate your request for my personal information, however, I would like to understand more about this process before proceeding further.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
