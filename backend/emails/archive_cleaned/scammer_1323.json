        "body": "Hello Senator Godswill Akpabio,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this urgent message. I appreciate your efforts in compensating the foreign scam victims. However, before I proceed, I have a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the meeting with the Nigeria President? What was discussed and how did it lead to the approval of these funds?\n\n2. Could you explain why Bank of Africa UBA has been chosen as the institution to handle these transactions? Are there any specific reasons for this choice?\n\n3. Is there any official documentation or paperwork that needs to be completed in order to receive the compensation? If so, what are the necessary steps involved?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed with claiming my Foreign Scam Victims Fund.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
