Could you please provide more details about the fund transfer order from the Government of Nigeria? \n\nAlso, could you explain how the process works with Standard Bank UK and what my role would be in it? I'm not very familiar with these financial procedures, so any additional information would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCourtney"
