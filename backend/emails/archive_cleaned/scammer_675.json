Could you please explain more about these Offshore Payment Centers? And why do I need to travel to two different countries? \n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the Original Funds Classified Document (OFCD)? What exactly does it entail?\n\nI'm really looking forward to hearing more details from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrank"
