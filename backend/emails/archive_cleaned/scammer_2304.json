However, I have a few questions before we proceed further.\n\nCould you please explain more about the process of moving funds to your bank in Madrid? Also, could you provide some details about the fiduciary who will assist me?\n\nI'm also curious about how long this process might take and if there are any costs involved that I should be aware of.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAmy"
