Can you tell me more about how I won this? I don't remember entering any Coca Cola contest.\n\nAlso, could you please explain why there's a fee involved? I'm not very familiar with these processes and would appreciate some clarification.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
