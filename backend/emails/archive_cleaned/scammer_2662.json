However, I must admit, I'm a bit confused as I don't recall having any overdue payments or dealings with the World Bank Group in Nigeria.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this payment? How did it come about and why was it approved for me? Also, could you explain a bit more about the process of receiving this payment via bank transfer or ATM Master Credit Card?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nGeorge"
