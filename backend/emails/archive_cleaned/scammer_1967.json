I can assure you that I am very much alive and well. \n\nAs for this Mr. Zeev Tuch, I'm afraid there seems to be some misunderstanding. I have never given anyone the power of attorney to claim any funds on my behalf.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this contract fund? How did it come into existence and why is it associated with my name? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRandy"
