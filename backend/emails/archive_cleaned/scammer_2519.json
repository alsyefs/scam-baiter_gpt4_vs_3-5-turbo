I'm glad your team was vigilant enough to catch the discrepancy.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this incident? How did your staff realize that the lady was not genuine? Also, what measures are being taken against the culprits?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSara"
