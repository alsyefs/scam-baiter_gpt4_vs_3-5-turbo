        "body": "Hello Mr. James Howard,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about my funds. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that there are funds floating in the Federal Reserve Bank's Online Banking computer database system under my name.\n\nCould you please provide more details on how these funds ended up in your system? Also, could you clarify what the Transfer Reflection Permission Clearance fees are and why they are necessary?\n\nI'm also curious about the mandate by the \"to conclude this payment assignment\". Could you elaborate more on who has issued this mandate and why it is set to expire soon?\n\nLastly, I would appreciate if you could explain a bit more about the process of moving unclaimed money to the government treasury account. Is this a common practice?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarl"
