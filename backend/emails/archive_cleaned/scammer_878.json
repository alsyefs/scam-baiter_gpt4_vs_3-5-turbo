        "body": "Dear Chief Justice Carlos G. Muiz,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the total sum of USA Dollars that is under your care for security purposes. I appreciate you taking the time to inform me about this matter.\n\nI must admit, I am a bit confused about the involvement of Mrs. Doris Woolwine in all of this. Could you please provide more details about her role and why she claims to be authorized to receive the funds on my behalf? Additionally, could you clarify how my chronic illness and a fatal accident are related to this situation?\n\nFurthermore, I would like to understand why you believe other people who have contacted me regarding my funds are not trustworthy. It's important for me to have a clear understanding of who I should trust in this matter.\n\nRegarding the purchase of US Steam wallet cards or US gift cards, could you explain why these specific items are required? How will they be used to redeem cash and facilitate the delivery of my ATM Master Card?\n\nLastly, I would appreciate it if you could provide more information about the fees involved in this process. It would be helpful for me to know what exactly these fees cover and how they contribute to ensuring a smooth transaction.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance and prompt attention. I look forward to receiving your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nTina"
