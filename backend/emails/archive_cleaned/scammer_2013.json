        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite a lot to take in, but I think I understand the gist of it. You're saying that there's a sum of money waiting for me, and all I need to do is pay a processing fee of USD? That sounds like an amazing opportunity!\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain why this payment is necessary? And how did my name come up for this opportunity? \n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the bank processing fee? Is it a standard procedure?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nNathan"
