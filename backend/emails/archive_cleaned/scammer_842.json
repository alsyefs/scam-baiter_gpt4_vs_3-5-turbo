        "body": "Hello Mr. Robert Justin,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope this message finds you well. I received your email regarding my ATM card funds that are still available for claim. I must say, it sounds quite intriguing.\n\nBefore we proceed further, could you please provide me with some more information? I would like to know how much funds are available on my ATM card and what steps need to be taken in order to claim them. Additionally, could you clarify why the fee needs to be paid using a Steam Wallet Card or Apple Gift Card? I'm not familiar with these methods of payment.\n\nI appreciate your assistance in providing these details so that we can move forward with the process. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nEva"
