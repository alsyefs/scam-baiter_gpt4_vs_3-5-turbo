        "body": "Hello Mr. John,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your efforts in delivering the funds to me. However, I have a few questions before we proceed. Can you please provide more details about the United Nations' involvement in this matter? How exactly did they determine that I am eligible for these funds?\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what you mean by \"scam lost and other unpaid salaries\"? I'm not aware of any such incidents or outstanding payments related to me.\n\nRegarding the information you requested, may I ask why my ID card is needed? Is there any way we can verify my identity through alternative means?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nScott"
