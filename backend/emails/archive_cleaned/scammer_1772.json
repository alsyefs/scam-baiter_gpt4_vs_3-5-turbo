        "body": "Hello Mr. Charles,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the payment that is due to me. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring that the funds are delivered safely and securely. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the specific lottery or contract that this payment is associated with? I want to make sure that I have all the necessary information.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned someone named Mr. Hayes Grant coming to your bank as my representative. I am not familiar with this person, and I did not authorize anyone to receive the funds on my behalf. Can you please clarify this situation?\n\nLastly, in order to proceed with setting up the Personal Online Banking Account, what documents or information do you require from me? I want to ensure that everything is done correctly.\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nFaith"
