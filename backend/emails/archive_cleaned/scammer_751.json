I must admit, I'm a bit confused as I don't recall having any business dealings in West Africa.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this contract? How did my name come up in connection with it? And what are the procedures that need to be followed for the transfer of funds?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCraig"
