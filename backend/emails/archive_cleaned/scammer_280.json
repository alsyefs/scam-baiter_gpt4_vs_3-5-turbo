        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the update regarding my payment file. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with any payments.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the charges that need to be deducted? What are these charges for?\n\n2. Is it possible to receive a breakdown of the deductions and the total amount that will be transferred to my bank account?\n\n3. Could you clarify why an affidavit and stamp duties from the High Court of Nigeria are required? How do these documents relate to my payment?\n\n4. Can you explain why the deduction fee needs to be sent through RIA or MoneyGram? Are there any alternative methods of payment available?\n\nI look forward to your prompt response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nTammy"
