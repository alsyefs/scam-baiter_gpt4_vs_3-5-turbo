I don't want you to assume this is a joke or that I'm trying to swindle you because you received the notification message to demonstrate you were truly contacted for this purpose. I chose to make it obvious to you that you have nothing to be concerned about, as I prayed and searched the internet for assistance through Microsoft and Google registered email addresses, and I chose you among others to undertake this assignment. You will get 30% of the money to support yourself as the person charged, while the remaining 70% will be used to aid those in your community who are less fortunate.\nFor the 70%, your responsibility is to deliver the following (for example, personal business development and advancement of children's educational programs) to the least fortunate in your community. Please see the link below for a fuller understanding, as well as testimonials from the National Lottery and my ongoing charity project website. So I'd appreciate it if you looked at the website below for a better understanding, so you can be certain that what I'm doing is for a good cause and not for evil.\nhttps: // www. dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2330727/How-Steve-Jobs-wife-secretly-gave-away-TEN-OF-MILLIONS-money-charity--critics-accused-doing-enough.html\nI understand that this may come as a shock to you, but you should be aware that your email address was chosen along with three (3) other lucky email addresses from millions of internet users around the world. The legal advisers/partners to this contribution program/project made a random selection and declared YOU as the lucky recipient of a cash grant of ten million United state dollars.\n I may not know you, but I feel that if God chose you to get my ten million United state dollars donation, you must be a God fearing individual, regardless of your faith or belief, ethnicity, or religion. I am Catholic, and I believe that good things come to those who wait and believe in God.\nThis entire process is simple and easy. \nYou will be required to open an online temporary debit-offshore account in your name with my financial institute where the ten million United state dollars cash giveaway donation is held here in the United States, as agreed by my legal counsel, who advised me that all donated funds to my beneficiaries MUST be completed through the use of an E-banking system so that I can maintain a better and secure form of communication with my beneficiaries.\nI eagerly anticipate your prompt response at your earliest convenience.\nBest regards,\nLaurene Powell Jobs.\n\"The Powell Foundation\"\nTel: +1 (713) 587-6726\nEmail: \ninfo@lpowellfoundation.com"
