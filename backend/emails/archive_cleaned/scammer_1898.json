        "body": "Hello Mr. Edun,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me! I'm quite surprised to hear about this Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. That's a lot of money! \n\nCould you please tell me more about how this fund ended up with the Central Bank of Nigeria? And why was it returned back from the US Government?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about this processing fee and the new pin code system? I'm not very familiar with these banking terms.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nHector"
