        "body": "Hello Jackson Steve,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your efforts in helping me claim my funds. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. Can you provide more details about the Executive Order signed by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu? What does it entail and how does it affect the release of my funds?\n\n2. How did you come across my name as one of the scam victims? Is there any specific incident or case that led to this discovery?\n\n3. Could you please clarify what you mean by \"stop any further with whoever concerning your payment\"? Are there any specific individuals or organizations I should avoid contacting regarding my funds?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed.\n\nBest wishes,\nJoseph"
