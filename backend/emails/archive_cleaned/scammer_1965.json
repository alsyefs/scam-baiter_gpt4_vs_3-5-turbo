However, I'm a bit confused as I don't recall sending any money or expecting any funds. Could you please provide more details about this situation? \n\nWhat is the nature of these funds? How did my name and address end up on this package? And why was it going to the wrong office?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in clearing up this confusion.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nNancy"
