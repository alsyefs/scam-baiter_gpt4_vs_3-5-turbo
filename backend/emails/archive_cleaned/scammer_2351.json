        "body": "Hello A. Wray,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. It's quite surprising to hear that my name was found in the Western Union database as someone who has sent money through their service.\n\nI'm curious, how did you come across my details? And could you please elaborate more on the process of receiving the Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars? \n\nAlso, I would like to know more about the role of the FBI in this case. How will they supervise it?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nTena"
