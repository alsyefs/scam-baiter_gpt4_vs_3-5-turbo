        "body": "Hello Ms. Kristalina Georgieva,\n\nWow, this is such an unexpected surprise! I can't believe my email address was found in one of those files. It's really amazing that you're working so hard to stop these scam artists and even more so that you're sharing the recovered funds with people like me.\n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts of your message though. Could you please explain how exactly the ATM card works? And why is there a need for a STAMP DUTY CHARGE? \n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the UPS COURIER COMPANY? I've never heard of them before. Are they reliable?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"

        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your detailed response. It's really helpful to understand the process better. I'm quite excited about receiving my ATM card and being able to withdraw money at any ATM machine around the world.\n\nI have a few more questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned something about a stamp duty that will prevent my card package from being stopped by customs. Could you please explain a bit more about this? How does it work exactly?\n\nAlso, I'm not very familiar with UPS COURIER EXPRESS DELIVERY COMPANY OR DHL COURIER EXPRESS DELIVERY COMPANY. Could you tell me more about their services? How long does delivery usually take?\n\nLastly, regarding the apple gift, could you clarify what exactly this is and how I should go about purchasing one?\n\nThank you so much for your time and patience in answering my questions.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
