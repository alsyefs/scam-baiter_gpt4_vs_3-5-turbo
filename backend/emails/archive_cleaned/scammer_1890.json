It's great to hear that it will be delivered to my address soon.\n\nBefore I provide you with my address and telephone number, could you please clarify a few things for me? Firstly, which company or organization is responsible for delivering the ATM card? Secondly, what is the purpose of indicating the ATM parcel number when contacting them?\n\nI want to make sure that everything is in order before proceeding further. Thank you for your understanding.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
