Could you please provide me with some additional information? Specifically, I would like to understand why the funds have not been received yet and what steps need to be taken to ensure they are properly allocated.\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know more about the Audit exceptions that were discovered. What were these exceptions and how do they impact the release of the funds? It is important for me to have a clear understanding of the situation before proceeding further.\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nShirlee"
