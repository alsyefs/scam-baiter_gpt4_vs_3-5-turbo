        "body": "Hello Mr. Michael Williams,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite interesting to hear about this fund, I wasn't aware of it before. Could you please explain a bit more about how this process works? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what the transfer permit is and why it's necessary? I'm not very familiar with these financial terms and procedures.\n\nYou mentioned something about a card PIN as well. What kind of card are we talking about here?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nTimothy"
