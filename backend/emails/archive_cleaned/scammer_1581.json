I would like to learn more about the process of transferring the funds.\n\nCould you please explain in more detail how the online banking service works? How secure is it? Also, what are the steps involved in a bank-to-bank wire transfer? I want to make sure that my funds are transferred safely and efficiently.\n\nRegarding the electronic transfer fee, could you clarify why there is a need for this fee? Is it a one-time payment or will there be any additional charges later on?\n\nIn order to proceed with the claim process, do you require any specific documents from me other than the ones mentioned? I want to ensure that all necessary paperwork is provided accurately.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
