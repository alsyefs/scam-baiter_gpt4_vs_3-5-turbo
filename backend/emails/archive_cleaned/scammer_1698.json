I'm doing quite alright myself, thank you for asking.\n\nRegarding the file you mentioned, could you please provide more details? I'm not sure which file you're referring to. Could it be something that got lost in the mail or perhaps an email that ended up in my spam folder?\n\nLooking forward to your response and clarification on this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
