        "body": "Dear Dr. Ahmed Bello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the payment under my name. I appreciate your concern and willingness to help resolve this situation. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the payment and the contracts documents you mentioned? I want to ensure that everything is in order and legitimate.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what NFIU stands for and how it relates to my payment? I want to make sure that all necessary procedures are followed correctly.\n\nLastly, could you explain why there is a possibility of my payment being cancelled? Is there anything specific that needs to be done on my end to prevent this from happening?\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nShirley"
