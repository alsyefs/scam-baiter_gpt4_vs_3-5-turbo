        "body": "Hello Mrs. Janet Louise Yellen,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I must say, your email has certainly piqued my interest! It's not every day that one receives an email about such a substantial sum of money.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some details. Could you please clarify what the United Nation TAG number is? And why is there a fee associated with it?\n\nAlso, could you provide more information about the United State Bank All Citizens Bank Trust? I've never heard of this bank before and would like to know more about it.\n\nLastly, could you explain why my occupation is needed for this process? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nCalvin"
