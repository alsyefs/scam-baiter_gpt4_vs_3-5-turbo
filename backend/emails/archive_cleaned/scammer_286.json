I appreciate your efforts in working on my fund file.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the online account activation process you mentioned. Could you please explain it to me in more detail? How does this process work and why is there a cost associated with it?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what documents Barrister Kelvin Arthur will be obtaining on my behalf? What are these documents for?\n\nLastly, I noticed that you asked for some personal details such as physical address, telephone number, scan copy of passport or any, and name of next of. However, I am not comfortable sharing these details over email due to privacy concerns. Is there another way we can proceed without sharing this information?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJacqueline"
