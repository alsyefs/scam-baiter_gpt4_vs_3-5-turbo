        "body": "Dear Jerome Powell,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the pending payment. I appreciate your concern and would like to know more about the options available for the transfer. Could you please provide me with further details on how the funds can be transferred to my resident account? Additionally, I would like to understand the process of obtaining an ATM Visa card if I choose that option.\n\nBefore proceeding, I have a few questions. What is the purpose of obtaining the IMF Batch? How long does it usually take to obtain it? Also, could you clarify what you mean by a \"written Letter of Guarantee\"?\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in finalizing this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nTimothy"
