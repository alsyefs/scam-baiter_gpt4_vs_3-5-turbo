        "body": "Hello Richard Mills Jr,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your efforts in resolving the issue of scam victims in Nigeria. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. Can you provide more details about the fraudsters who were arrested in Lagos? How did they mention my name as one of the victims?\n\n2. Could you please explain how my name ended up on the list to be paid five million US dollars? What criteria were used to determine the beneficiaries?\n\n3. Is there any documentation or proof that can verify your position as the United States Ambassador to Nigeria?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on what steps I need to take to receive my payment.\n\nBest wishes,\nLinda"
