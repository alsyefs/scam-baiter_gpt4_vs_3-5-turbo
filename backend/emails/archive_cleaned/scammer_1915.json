        "body": "Hello Mr. James Williams,\n\nWow, that's quite a shocking news to hear about myself! I can assure you that I am very much alive and well. I'm sorry for any confusion this may have caused.\n\nI'm curious though, how did this person claiming to be my next of kin find out about the fund? And why would they think I had an accident? It's all very strange.\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the Apple Gift Card or Steam Wallet you mentioned? How does it relate to proving that I'm alive?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nKenton"
