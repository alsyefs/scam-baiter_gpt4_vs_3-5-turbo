        "body": "Hello Mr. Shegetoshi Fujii,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite surprised to hear about this situation, but I must admit it's a bit confusing. Could you please explain more about how the United Nations and The IMF Monetary Fund Asia Regional Payment Office are involved in this? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"scammed victims\"? How was this list of victims compiled and how did my name end up on it? \n\nI'm also curious about the payment process. You mentioned there is no upfront payment required, but a deposit will be mandated. Could you provide more details about this deposit?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
