I'm curious, how does this process usually work? \n\nAlso, could you please clarify what you mean by \"STOP any further with your associate in any of the African European Asian countries\"? I'm not sure I fully understand.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nGuy"
