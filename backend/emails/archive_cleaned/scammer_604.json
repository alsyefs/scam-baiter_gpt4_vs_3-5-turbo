Could you please provide more details about this fund benefit? How was it decided who would be eligible for this financial support?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the process? You mentioned that our bank accounts will be credited within hours of a banking working day. What does that entail exactly?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nWendi"
