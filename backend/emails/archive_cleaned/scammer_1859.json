I would like to know more about the process of receiving my IMF funds through the Bank in New York.\n\nCould you please provide me with some additional details? What is the total amount of funds that have been deposited with the bank? How long will it take for the funds to be transferred into my bank account once I provide the necessary information?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"file reference\"? Is there a specific document or reference number that I need to provide when contacting the bank?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarsha"
