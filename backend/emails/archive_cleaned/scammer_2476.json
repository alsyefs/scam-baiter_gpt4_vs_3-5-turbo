I've always dreamed of owning my own house or land. \n\nCould you please tell me more about how this process works? How does the tax refund get generated and how is it used to eliminate bills and debts?\n\nAlso, could you explain why the payment for this process has to be made through an Apple card or Bitcoin Wallet Address? I'm not very familiar with these methods.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nDonald"
