        "body": "Hello Rev. Ben Robinson,\n\nThank you for reaching out and explaining the situation to me. I must admit, I was not aware that my name was on a blacklist. This is quite surprising news.\n\nI'm curious about how this happened. Could you please provide more details about how names end up on this blacklist? Also, could you explain more about the process of removing a name from it?\n\nYou mentioned a GIFT CARD fee for the insurance of removing my name from the blacklist. How does this work exactly? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLillian"
