        "body": "Hello Mr. Bemard Lauwers,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite exciting to hear about this approved payment! I must say, it's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name end up on the approved list? And could you please explain a bit more about this World Bank Assisted Programmer of Payment and WB NF UN Debt Settlement Panel? It sounds very official and important.\n\nAlso, I'd like to know more about the process of transferring these funds. How does it work exactly? And what is an immediate release of funds?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nFloyd"
