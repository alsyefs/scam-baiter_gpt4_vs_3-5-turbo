I appreciate your trust in me and your desire to use the funds for a noble cause such as building an orphanage home.\n\nI understand that you have all the necessary proof of fund documents, which is great. Could you please provide me with more details about the bank where the money was deposited?

It would be helpful to have a clear understanding of what is required before proceeding further.\n\nRegarding your health, I hope you are doing well despite being at the hospital. Please take care of yourself and prioritize your recovery. If there is anything I can do to support you during this time, please let me know.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDeborah"
