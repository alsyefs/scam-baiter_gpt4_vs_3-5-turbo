However, I have a few questions before proceeding with the payment.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the fee that needs to be paid? What is it for and how much is the amount? Additionally, can you explain what an Escrow account is and how it relates to my transfer?\n\nI want to ensure that everything is clear before making any payments.
