I understand the importance of security measures in such matters.\n\nI have a few questions before I proceed with selecting a delivery option. Firstly, could you please provide more information about the GSCS Gold, Silver, and Bronze Days Delivery options? What are the differences between them in terms of mailing, insurance, VAT, and total cost?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know how long it usually takes for the delivery to be made once the payment is confirmed. Is there any way to track the progress of the delivery online?\n\nLastly, you mentioned that my ATM Card has been insured by Nicon Insurance in case of loss or theft.
