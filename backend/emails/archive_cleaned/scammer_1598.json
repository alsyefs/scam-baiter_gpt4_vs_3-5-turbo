Actually, my first letter may come to you as a surprise. i came across your e-mail contact through a private search while in need of your assistance. I'm writing to you now with heavy sorrow in my heart, i have chosen to reach out to you through the internet because it still remains the fastest medium of communication and i prayed over it before contacting you as a real child of god. Besides, I would like to explain myself to you. I am from London but married to an african man from Republic of Benin after I was twenty years old and we live together in London and since I married my beloved husband I did not conceived since i married which is most important thing of marriage and been my dear husband was a god fearing man also love me so much, he did not complain for any day and for that reasons I made a promised to him that I will be with him all the day of my life It's not easy to see a lovely man who can tolerate such from a woman he married without giving a child and reasons of marriage is to build family while I did not, it means fail him before his death. Beside, my husband is from a big family here in Benin and after his death I decided to leave London and come back to his country to honor him as I promised, when I came to Benin I fell sick which I did not take it as big thing and after some months am going down day by day then I went back to London to see my doctor, through there my doctor recognized the point of my sickness and also said I have few months to live, my dear in lord, I cried for one month and ask god is it how you wish to me, if it's how you want me to end up my life in pain let his wish be done, then I later came back to my husband home in Benin to complete my promises and my husband senior brother was in Russian for years without coming home I stay with the junior one, that is reason I handle over the money to a foreign in that way you was surprised because he is one I trusted to handle my husband wealth as I wish, but he refused to pick my call or communicate with me since I lost my husband. So please my dear In lord, I wish you should bear with me in my wish because I can not do what is not right to whom it may be on the earth because i must answer god at the end if I do. The reason I take this decision is that my health has deteriorated so badly, I can not do this by myself anymore. I once asked members of my husband Family here in Benin to distribute one of my accounts to some charitable organization which they refused and kept the money to themselves, so, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be satisfied with what I left for them. I will wait to hear from you. Thanks,Your sister in the lord.Mrs. Melissa Richardson.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\nDear Mrs. Melissa Richardson,\r\nI am deeply moved by your message and the trust you have placed in me. I assure you that as a devoted servant of God, I will use these funds for the betterment of our community and to spread His word.\r\nHowever, before we proceed, could you please provide more details about how you would like these funds to be used? Are there any specific charitable causes or projects that are close to your heart?\r\nMay God bless you and give you strength during this difficult time.\r\nBest wishes,Kathleen"
