We have come across your contact details and records with one of these Banks. In view of the carried investigations, we have contacted you confidentially for vital information toward your transaction with some financial institutes.

Upon our investigation conclusion, we found out that your transaction was legitimate and for this reason, a compensation amount of $3,150,500 (Three million one hundred and fifty thousand, five hundred dollars) has been allocated to you for immediate payment through our accredited bank, EURO BANK- PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS.\nKindly contact the compensation paying officer with the below details.\nName: Mr. Jones Larry\nEmail: \nofficialjoneslarry@gmail.com\nThanks.\nYours sincerely,\nMichael D.
