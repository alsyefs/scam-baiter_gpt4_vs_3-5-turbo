Your name came up in our files as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received their funds. The fund was abandoned due to some administrative issues which we are now trying to rectify.\n\nThe ATM Master Card is a secure method of transferring funds. It works just like any other ATM card. Once the funds are loaded onto the card, you can withdraw them at any ATM machine that accepts Master Cards. This method is secure because only you will have access to the card and its PIN.\n\nThe Fund Release Clearance is a necessary document that needs to be obtained from the Bureau office before any fund can be released. It serves as proof that all necessary checks have been done and that the fund is ready for release.\n\nI hope this clarifies your queries. Please let me know if you need more information.\n\nBest regards,\nMrs.\n\nBest wishes,\nGreg"
