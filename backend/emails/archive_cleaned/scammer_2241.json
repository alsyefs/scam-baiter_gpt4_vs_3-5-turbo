        "body": "Hello Jones,\n\nThank you for your prompt response. It's great to hear that the process can be expedited through an ATM Cash Card. I'm always open to more efficient methods!\n\nHowever, before we proceed, could you please provide me with some additional information? I would like to understand more about this process. For instance, how does the ATM Cash Card work? Is it similar to a regular debit card that I can use at any ATM?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the courier company that will be handling the delivery? It would be reassuring to know their name and track record.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarina"
