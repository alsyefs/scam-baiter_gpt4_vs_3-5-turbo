Recently we arrested a man named Francisco Zuela a Ghanian Citizen who works with D.H.L office in Lagos with an ATM CARD with your name on it as the beneficiary and the owner of the card. However the entire parcel containing the proof of claim ownership which is also in your name has so far been recovered from him.\nAfter we arrested and interrogated him, he confessed as stated below. My name is Francisco Zuela, I work with the D.H.L office in Nigeria. February this year, I was approached by a lawyer asking me to  divert a parcel containing an ATM DEBIT CARD belonging to you. I agreed and we collaborated to divert the card to another address in your country from where to be sure it confirmed entry into your country after which it was returned back to Nigeria to avoid any suspicion.\nLater we wrote to the Issuing bank as the beneficiary and with the help of the collaborator, the risk and management department of the bank gave me the pin code of the card. Since then I have been making withdrawals with my collaborators until this week when the card was blocked by the bank that I should contact the issuing bank. I have made withdrawals of about USDUS86,800.00 within this period.\nThe above is the suspect's confession and we have contacted the card issuing bank who also told us that there was an initial complaint from the beneficiary  though the identity of the mentioned person was not disclosed. They confirmed that there was an application from you to re-release the ATM Card Pin upon receipt which directly was sent to an email with your name but they are not aware that you have not received the card since you did not inform them hence the card was diverted.\nWe would like to hear from you immediately to enable us carry out action as well make arrangements for the ATM CARD $15.5million to be re-dispatched to you without any delay upon reconciliation with the issuing bank. From our secret investigation so far, we have confirmed that this suspect is in collaboration with some officials of the bank to divert this CARD without your knowledge which is confirmed in our Investigation. At this point, do not communicate with anyone to avoid leakage of information until we are able to arrest everyone involved.\nUpon your response, we shall forward an official notification to the Director Internal Regulatory Department of your country Consulate here in Nigeria. And also you are to make a payment of $560 for us to get back your ATM CARD to you with insurance. We have to re-validate and insure the ATM CARD everything will cost $560  Get back to me with your phone number, your current house address and a copy of your Identification Card.\nWaiting for your Immediate Response.\nDsp Matthew Anderson\nLagos State\nForce Public Relation Officer   "

        "body": "Hello Dsp Matthew Anderson,\n\nThank you for reaching out and informing me about this situation. It's quite surprising to hear that someone has been using an ATM card in my name without my knowledge. I appreciate the efforts of the Nigeria Police Force in apprehending the suspect.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. How did you come across my contact information? And how can I be sure that this isn't just a misunderstanding?\n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about the process of recovering the ATM card? You mentioned a payment for insurance, but I'm not entirely clear on what that entails.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJacqueline"
