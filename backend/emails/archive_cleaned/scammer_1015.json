        "body": "Greetings dear friend,\n \nI Am Mr. Jozef Julien Etienne, a banker here in Belgium. I write you this very confidential proposal in good faith, hoping that I will rely on you. In 2010, Mr. Albert Guido, who hails from your country as his place of origin/birth made a fixed deposit, valued â‚¬28,750,000 (Twenty-Eight Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Euros) with our bank in Belgium. He was an oil merchant and an Engineering contractor.\n \nHe came here to Belgium for an Engineering work exploration from your country before he deposited his Swiss account in Switzerland. I was his account officer. Unfortunately, while on a business trip, he died in a deadly Tsunami earthquake that occurred in Sendai Japan on March 11, 2011, which killed many people.\n \nThe management of our bank has been sourcing for a means to reach him to ascertain if he would want to roll over the Deposit, or have the contract sum withdrawn, When I discovered that this would happen, I learned of his death, so I have tried to think up a procedure to preserve this fund and use the proceed for charity. Our Bank Managing director has been trying to find out the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed to my heart because I know that if they become aware of his death, they will corner the funds for themselves and their private use and leave me with nothing.\n \nTherefore, I am seeking your cooperation to present you as the one to benefit from his fund at his death. So that my bank headquarters will pay the funds to you. I have made enough inside the bank arrangements already and I only have to put your details into the information network in the bank computers database and reflect you as his next of kin to the deceased Albert Guido.\n \nThis is a smooth and risk-free operation as long as no one else besides you and I know about this. I immensely request your optimum honesty and cooperation. Let me know your opinion on this, and please treat this information with utmost confidentiality. We will go over the details as soon as I receive your urgent response strictly through my email address, my email address is (\njozefes47@gmail.com\n)\n \nPlease observe this instruction religiously. I am a family man with a daughter. \nI am sending you this mail not without a measure of doubt as to what the consequences could be for me if my Bank finds out about my secret plan. Please let this be a top secret between us.\n \nThe sharing formula would be 45% for me, 45% for you, and then 10% for Charity.\nPlease let \"CONFIDENTIALITY\" be our watchword until success is achieved.\nBest Regards,\nMr. Jozef Julien Etienne"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Jozef Julien Etienne,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I must say, your proposal is quite intriguing and it's not every day that one receives such an interesting offer. \n\nI'm curious about a few things though, if you don't mind me asking. How did you come across my contact information? And why have you chosen me for this particular task? I'm just an ordinary person with no special skills or connections.\n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about the charity aspect of this plan? Which charities are we talking about here?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLoren"
