Please take note that you will pay for Notarization & exchange control fee and this is the only financial obligation that you will undertake to receive the Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only through the World Remit Money Transfer.\n \nLastly,i will like you to reconfirm your information to me such as your full name, address and telephone number\n so that I will proceed with your World Remit Money Transfer within the next 48hrs and the transaction information will be released to you.\n \nI await your response for further proceedings.\n \nSincerely yours,\n \nMs. Fatoumata Ndiaye\nUnder-Secretary-General\nUnited Nations."

        "body": "Hello Ms. Fatoumata Ndiaye,\n\nThank you for your message and the information provided. It's quite interesting to hear about this arrangement between the United Nations and the African Union. I must say, it's a bit surprising but I'm intrigued.\n\nI'm curious though, could you please explain more about this World Remit Money Transfer? How does it work exactly? And what is this exchange control fee you mentioned?\n\nAlso, I'd like to know more about these Tax Clearance and bank charges that I would need to pay. Could you provide some details on those as well?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
