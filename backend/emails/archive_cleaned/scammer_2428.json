I must admit, I don't recall any contracts with them.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this contract? When was it established and what does it entail? Also, how did my name come up in connection with this?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMagdalene"
