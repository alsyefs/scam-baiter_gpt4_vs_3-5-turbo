For more\r\n   clarification. Like the agreement reads, the funds in question origin are\r\n   from Nigeria and the Origin certificate will be included on the huge amount\r\n   of money I will pay on your behalf for all the classified documents that\r\n   will be issued by the offices that is in charge to back the funds. The only\r\n   fees you will pay will be for their accredited attorney that will represent\r\n   you in signing for the release order of the funds US10M, that is if you\r\n   cannot come to Nigeria for the signing of some relevant documents that must\r\n   be signed by the Beneficiary which is you, because the payment receipt must\r\n   bear your name and address which make it to be authentic and will indicate\r\n   that it is from you, because I will not be allowed to sign as it is the\r\n   sole duty of the accredited attorney and i cannot tell the exact amount\r\n   though it will not be much. I will advise that we should go for a Bank to\r\n   Bank transfer which is easier, because it will be deposited in your\r\n   provided account in less than 48 hours.\r\n   -\r\n   Barrister Bayo Jacobs\r\n   Jacob Chambers & Solicitors, Nigeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Sincerely Yours,\r\n\r\n   Barr Bayo Jacobs\n- Attorney at Law."
