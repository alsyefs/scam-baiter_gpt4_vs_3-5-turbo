        "body": "Hello Thomas White,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. It's quite surprising to hear about this payment file from the Africa Bank. I must admit, I'm not very familiar with Bitcoin wallet accounts. Could you please explain how it works? \n\nAlso, could you provide more details about these \"affected scam victims\"? How did the bank determine who was affected? \n\nI'm a bit confused about the information you're asking for. You mentioned needing a copy of my passport, my home address, and my private telephone number. However, I've been advised not to share personal information online for security reasons.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nTimothy"
