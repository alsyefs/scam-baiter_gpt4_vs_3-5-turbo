        "body": "Hello Mr. David Phillipson,\n\nThank you for your detailed email about the storage tanks and their capacities. It's quite impressive to know that you have such large storage facilities at Houston, Fujairah, and Rotterdam ports.\n\nI'm curious about the process you've outlined. Could you please elaborate on what exactly a Letter Of Intent (LOI) should include? Also, could you provide more information about the Tank Storage Agreement (TSA)? What are its terms and conditions?\n\nAdditionally, I'd like to understand more about the payment process. You mentioned that upon receipt of a signed storage contract by the Lessee, an invoice is issued for reserving the storage tank space. How is this payment made? Is there a specific method or platform that needs to be used?\n\nLastly, I'm interested in knowing more about the cancellation policy. If a Lessee decides not to use the reserved tank space again, how does this process work? Are there any penalties or fees associated with it?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJeanne"
