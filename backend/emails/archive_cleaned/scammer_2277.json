        "body": "Hello Mr. Oliver Alawuba,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the registration of my ATM card and the shipment details. I appreciate your efforts in keeping me informed about this process.\n\nI have a few questions before proceeding with the payment for the insurance delivery and security fee. Could you please provide me with more information about the courier company that my ATM card is registered with? I would like to know their name and contact details so that I can verify their authenticity.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what you mean by \"the next items will be shipped in hours\"? Are there any other items being shipped along with my ATM card?\n\nRegarding the payment, I would like to know more about the transfer services of World Remit or Ria. How secure are these services, and what are the steps involved in making the payment through them? Also, why do I need to provide my nearest airport address and a valid photo ID?\n\nLastly, could you explain why it is necessary to send an iTunes Gift Card or Steam Wallet scan? How does this relate to the payment for the insurance delivery and security fee?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nTravis"
