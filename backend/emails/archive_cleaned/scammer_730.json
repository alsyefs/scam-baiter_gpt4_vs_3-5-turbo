Order No:FEC/IMFFI231282.\nFMF CODE 0989.\nAttention: The Beneficiary,\nWe have been instructed to contact you, following the Federal Executive Council and the International Monetary fund meeting this morning which resolved that the Federal Government of Benin will pay a compensation sum of US$15.5M to you and the payment should be made through our partner financial institution via Automated Teller Machine{ATM} Card.\nThis resolution was made following series of allegations from foreign beneficiaries that they had been swindled by some hoodlums of their hard earned money running into thousands of dollars.\nIn effort to curtail this trend, it was resolved by the Federal Executive Council to make your payment through a separate financial institution that is not Central Bank of Benin because of some inherent financial difficulties made possible by the statutory provision regulating the functions of the Economic Community of West African states {ECOWAS} Central Banks in matters of retail banking.\nOwing to the urgent need to expedite action in the immediate transfer of your compensation sum, you are hereby officially informed that we have verified your payment file and have found out that you have not received your compensation amount of US$15.5M through the interswitch ATM Card procedure.\nConsequently, \nyou are required to forward to us the following information:\nYour receiving name and address:\nDirect telephone number:\nAge:\nOccupation:\nID Card\n:  \nsend all the delivery address to this email at : \nemmanuelanthony011@yahoo.com\nYOU WILL CONTACT AGENT ON WHATSAPP. +22954538741\nNote: In our next mail we will instruct you on how you will operate your ATM Card in any ATM machine around you or any bank around you to cash your funds.\nBest Regards,\nRev Emmanuel Anthony\nDirector Interswitch, UBA PLC,"
