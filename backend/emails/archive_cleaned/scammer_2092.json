        "body": "Hello Mrs. Monica,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and sharing your story. I'm really sorry to hear about the difficult situation you and your daughter are going through. It must be incredibly tough for both of you.\n\nI understand that you're looking for someone who can provide a home and take care of your daughter, Zlata, in case something happens to you during the surgery. It's important to ensure her well-being and future.\n\nTo answer your questions, I am , and I am currently . Unfortunately, I don't have any children of my own at the moment. However, I believe that family is not just about blood relations but also about love, care, and support. If it comes to welcoming Zlata into my home, I would do my best to make her feel loved and cared for as a family member.\n\nRegarding the investment of the funds, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about your late husband's deposited fund. What kind of investment opportunities are available? Are there any specific guidelines or restrictions on how the money should be invested?\n\nAs for sending copies of my driver's license, I prefer not to share personal identification documents online for security reasons. However, we can explore alternative ways to establish trust and ensure transparency in our communication.\n\nPlease let me know how we can proceed further in discussing this matter. If there's anything else you'd like to know or discuss, please feel free to ask.\n\nBest wishes,\nJon"
