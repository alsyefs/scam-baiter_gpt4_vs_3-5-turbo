        "body": "Hello George Yeboa,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite intrigued by your message, although I must admit, it's a bit confusing. Could you please clarify what you mean by \"wash and clean my found and open any box\"? \n\nAlso, when you mention \"contract file\", could you provide more details about this? I don't recall having any contracts that would require such attention.\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nKenneth"
