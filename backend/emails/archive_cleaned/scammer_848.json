        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected message. I'm a bit confused about the situation though. Could you please clarify what exactly these scam officials have been saying about me? \n\nAlso, it's very generous of you to offer such a large sum of money as compensation. However, I'm not sure why I would be receiving this amount? Could you explain that part a bit more?\n\nLastly, regarding the delivery options, could you provide more details on how each one works? And why is there a fee associated with them?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSteven"
