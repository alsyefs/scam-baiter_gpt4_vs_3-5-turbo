        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your effort in explaining the situation. However, I have a few questions that I would like to clarify before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why there was a delay in my payments last year? Also, what is the special bonus that Ria Money Transfer is offering?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned a sum of money that I need to pay but it seems like the amount was not specified in your message. Could you please tell me how much exactly do I need to pay?\n\nThirdly, you mentioned about some numbers that I should not expose to anybody else. What are these numbers and why should they be kept confidential?\n\nLastly, could you please provide more details about the new project that will start after four days? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLillie"
