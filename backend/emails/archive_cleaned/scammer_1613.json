        "body": "  Dear,\nI hope you will attend to this mail urgently.\nI am the Deputy Luggage Inspector at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), California.\nWe received some yet to be cleared deliveries from other international airports in the country for sorting and eventual confiscation / destruction since most of them have stayed more than a year without claimant / clearance. And in my routine high-tech pre-scanning to ascertain their real content, the scan result of one gray colored case with scanty report that it contains personal effects, turned out to be containing cash money to my consternation.\nTo ascertain the authenticity of the money in the baggage, I have already made a lot of expenses to confirm from a specialist in the Federal Reserve Bank that the result of the scan was authentic $100 notes estimated to be over five million dollars ($5,000 000.00)\nI hope to hear immediately from you, to tell you more, and let's have a mutually beneficial deal to clear the box and share the money 60:40. 40% to me.\nThis mail should be treated with utmost confidentiality because the information I am sharing with you is only known between the two of us now.\nNote that the Federal Reserve Bank expert that confirmed the scan result does not know me in person, nor does he know where I work or where the scan came from since I used coded coordinates to interact with and pay him.\nFrom all indications, if by next week no one claims it, for onward delivery, it will be turned over to the Treasury Department for confiscation.\nLet me hear urgently from you for more details.\nYours Sincerely,\nMr. Michael Collins.\n(213 352 5615)   "

        "body": "Dear Mr. Michael Collins,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this urgent matter. I must say, your email has piqued my curiosity. I'm interested to learn more about the situation and how we can potentially work together.\n\nCould you please provide me with some additional information? Specifically, I would like to know how you came across this gray colored case in the first place. Additionally, what kind of personal effects were initially reported to be inside the case?\n\nFurthermore, I would appreciate it if you could explain the process of confirming the authenticity of the money with the specialist from the Federal Reserve Bank. How did you manage to contact them and what methods did they use to verify the scan result?\n\nLastly, I would like to understand how we can proceed with this mutually beneficial deal that you mentioned. What are your expectations in terms of sharing the money? And what steps need to be taken in order to clear the box and ensure a smooth delivery?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon and discussing this further.\n\nBest wishes,\nLori"

        "body": "It’s good to hear from you. I appreciate your timely response. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first mail was clear enough. And as In that mail, I alone know the content of the box having carried out a discrete high-tech scanning of it, and would want it to remain a secret until we follow the legitimate process to clear and have it delivered to you (us).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe luggage was detained for improper declaration of content, and also the inability of the courier diplomat to pay a clearance / processing fee of US$3,200 required to handle the luggage as diplomatic luggage which it was designated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I will apply on your behalf and once approval is granted, it will be processed for release and delivery to you. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my part I will do my possible best to take care of the fees. I will work to put the money together to make the payment if approval is granted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if my application is approved, it means the box legally belongs to you for legitimate continuation of the delivery after the payment of the clearance fee ($3,200.00)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I will do all I can to accompany the courier for the delivery to you, so as to wade off any interference on the delivery route till it's handed over and also to have my share. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have to assure me that when we are through with this deal, I must have my share which I proposed to be 40% of any amount in the box. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou know it's easy to make promises in the absence of tangible reality. But soon, this deal will become a success, and I don't want greed to manifest in any form; that is why I am emphasizing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI need your contact address or nearest airport and as well as your complete names to proceed if you are interested. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nYours Respectfully,\r\n\r\nMr. Michael Collins. \r\n\r\n213 352 5615"
