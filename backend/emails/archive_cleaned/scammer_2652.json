        "body": "Hello there,\n\nWow, this is quite a lot of information to take in! I'm really flattered by the opportunity to be considered as an ambassador for Africa refugees. It's such an important cause and I'd love to help out in any way I can.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that my name needs to be registered as an ambassador through Ambassador Ina J. Mohammed Deputy. Could you please explain more about this process? How long does it usually take?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about receiving funds after the process is completed. Could you clarify what these funds are for? Are they meant for personal use or are they specifically for helping the refugees?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about Chief Ambassador Ina J. Mohammed Deputy? What is her role exactly and how will she assist me in this process?\n\nThank you so much for your time and patience in answering my questions!\n\nBest wishes,\nAngie"
