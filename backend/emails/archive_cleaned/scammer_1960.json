I must admit, I'm not very familiar with the intricacies of international finance or the oil industry, but I'm always eager to learn more.\n\nCould you perhaps explain a bit more about how this process works? How is it possible to have an over-invoiced amount? And why is it necessary to transfer these funds into a foreign account?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nEdward"
