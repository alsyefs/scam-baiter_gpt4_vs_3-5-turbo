If you can remember, I want to let you know the best way you will receive the us$10m without being frustrated and keep paying fees and after fees because there is no end to that.\n \nWell, let me start by letting you know who I am and my fruitful intentions. I am Mr Joseph Miller, Chairman Debt Reconciliation Committee Offshore Central. It is very unfortunate that my country Nigeria has gotten a very bad reputation but there are several of us who still want to redeem our image from the international community.\n I am very much aware of how you are struggling trying to receive your funds worth us$10m and making payments after payments.\n \nI want to let you know the truth and nothing but the truth because I have the key to the successful conclusion of this transaction and with my position, I want to let you know that the actual amount which is us$1b and not us$10m but they want to use you and deceive you by the end of the day and I hope you understand what I mean. I mean they people that introduced you to this deal, The only way you are going to receive this funds safely is by wire transfer which only me have the key to the successful conclusion.\n \nI want you to be very close to me and I want a situation I can trust you because there are a lot of things we can do together in so far as I can trust you. You have to give me a promise that you will not let anybody know of my involvement with you and you will not let me down when they funds finally get to you in your designated country.\n  We are going to share the fund (US$1BILLION)(firstly us$10m )50% equally because I know what to do and after I will let you know the true source of this fund. You can always call me on my private telephone number +234-907-882-8372 further discussions and clarifications.\n \nYou will be making payments after payments if you don't listen to my fruitful advice. Always mark my words.\n \nAlso bear in mind that this way will cost you almost nothing before you receive the required funds. Keep everything secret unless you want to keep paying and paying without getting the funds at the end of the day. Always mark my words because it will definitely come to pass. This will cost a litter fee\n \nUntil I hear from you.\n \nYours sincerely,\nMr Joseph Miller    "

        "body": "Hello Mr. Joseph Miller,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and sharing this information. I must say, it's quite intriguing! I'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify what exactly this deal is about? You mentioned something about funds worth US dollars, but I didn't quite catch the details.\n\nAlso, you mentioned that there are a lot of things we can do together as long as there is trust between us. Could you elaborate on what kind of things you're referring to?\n\nI appreciate your advice and will certainly keep everything secret as per your request. However, I'm curious about the \"litter fee\" you mentioned. What does that entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTerry"
