        "body": "Hello Mr. Darlington Ozurumba,\n\nWow, this is such an unexpected surprise! I can't believe there was a sum of USD just sitting around in the Central Bank of West African States that belongs to me. I'm really curious about how you found out about this abandoned fund and why it was left unclaimed?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about how the ATM Master Card works? How can I withdraw the money from it in my country? \n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDebra"
