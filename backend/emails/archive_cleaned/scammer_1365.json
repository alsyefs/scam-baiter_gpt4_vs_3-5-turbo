        "body": "Hello Captain from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA,\n\nWow! Your message is quite a surprise. I'm not sure how you found my profile but it's always nice to meet new people. It's interesting that you used a software robot to find profiles online. How does that work? \n\nI'm glad to hear that you have a good heart and are down to earth. Those are qualities I admire in people. You mentioned your religious background as Catholic Christian with Jewish heritage from your mother, that's quite diverse! How has this influenced your life?\n\nAs for me, I like to keep things simple and enjoy the little things in life too. My hobbies include reading, gardening and taking long walks in the park. I believe in being kind to others and treating everyone with respect.\n\nYou mentioned having something important to share with me in your next mail. That sounds intriguing! Can you give me a hint about what it might be? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nEddy"
