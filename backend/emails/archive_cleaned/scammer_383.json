        "body": "Hello Diplomat Charles Emmanuel,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope you are doing well. Your email definitely came as a surprise, but I'm curious to know more about this package that you mentioned. Can you please provide me with some additional details? What exactly is in the package and why was my name chosen by the United Nations?\n\nAlso, I appreciate your concern about potential scams. It's always important to be cautious when dealing with unfamiliar situations. Could you please explain how I can verify the authenticity of this delivery? Is there any official documentation or reference number that I should look out for?\n\nI would also like to know how long it will take for the package to reach me once all the necessary information is provided. Additionally, could you clarify what you meant by \"do all the papers and documents that are due for this delivery\"? What kind of paperwork is required from my end?\n\nThank you again for contacting me, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLouise"
