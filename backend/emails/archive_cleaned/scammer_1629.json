For the sharing of the money will be shared in the ratio of 50% for me, 40% for you and 10% to cover our expenses after the deal.\nNow the total amount to be transferred is $12.2 million because of the interest the fund has accumulated for some recent time.\nPlease keep this absolutely confidential and tell me if you are interested but I can assure you 100% risk free as I know how to go about it.\nWaiting for your urgent reply and call.\nThanks.\nGabriel Robert\nEmail: \ngabrielrobert850@outlook.com\nNB. If you can't get through to me by email call my telephone number."
