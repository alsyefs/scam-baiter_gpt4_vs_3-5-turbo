        "body": "Hello Mrs. Angela Daniels,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my abandoned file at the Justice Department office. I appreciate your concern and willingness to help me with this matter. Can you please provide more details about the specific funds that are being referred to? I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of the situation.\n\nAdditionally, could you explain why the government is threatening to confiscate the funds? Is there a specific reason or legal issue that needs to be addressed?\n\nI am also curious about the process of obtaining the affidavits and waiver. How long does it usually take to complete these documents, and what is their purpose in releasing the funds?\n\nLastly, could you please clarify how much money is required for the swearing of affidavits and obtaining the waiver? I want to ensure that I have a clear understanding of all costs involved.\n\nThank you again for your assistance. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
