I'm quite surprised to hear about this situation, as I am very much alive and have not entered into any such agreement with Jerome Karlze. \n\nCould you please provide more details about this unclaimed deposit? How did it come to be in my name? And how can we rectify the misunderstanding with Mr. Karlze?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nPam"
