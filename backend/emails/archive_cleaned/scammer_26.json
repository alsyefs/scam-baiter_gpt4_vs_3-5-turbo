        "body": "  Dear Friend,\nIn accordance to my religious persuasion,I felt expedient to write and\ninform you on the wicked conspiracy hatched by the duo of JUSTICE\nAKANBI and Mr.Naiyaju of the Ministry of Finance to divert your money\nto their designated account in Europe.\nAs a junior staff,I discovered that they moved the Funds from Lagos to\nSPAIN and from SPAIN; they have moved it last week to Banca D'Italia\nin ITALY. Today I found out through the Central computer database that\nthey are about to reroute your fund to JP MORGAN CHASE BANK in United\nStates. With this,I felt that it is important for me to alert you on\nthis development.\nThey are still using your name and contract/inheritance identification\nnumber as the beneficiary but they have changed the account\nco-ordinate,that is why they are frustrating you by asking for money\nevery time in order for them to go behind and contact you. I have the\nreference number of the transaction and also I have the number of the\nofficial who is directly in charge at the JP MORGAN CHASE BANK in\nUnited States.\nYour Funds is supposed to go through the London credit control\nfinancial clearinghouse before finally Lodge in JP MORGAN CHASE BANK\nin United States.All the data about your claim profile are within my\nreach. I do not need gratification from you either in cash or kind; I\ncan never be a part of evil because the bible said YE SHALL KNOW THE\nTRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE.\nPlease respect my discretion in this matter, you can send an email to\nme so that I can give you the reference number and the name and\ncontact information of the officials of the JP MORGAN CHASE BANK in\nUnited States. I repeat, please do not expose my person, it is not\neasy to get jobs around here and I cannot contend with these powerful\nindividuals because they can eliminate me just like that.\n1) Your full name.\n2) Phone, fax and mobile #.\n3) Company name, position and address.\n4) Profession, age and marital status.\n5) Working I'd/Int'l passport.\nYou can reach me through my email:\nThanks and God bless.\nRev Johnson Ibe   "
