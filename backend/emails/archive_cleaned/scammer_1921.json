        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't expecting any packages, especially not one of such value. \n\nCould you please provide more details about my colleague who registered this package? I know quite a few people in the United States and it would be helpful to know who exactly has sent me this generous gift.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the \"Security Keeping Fee\" is for? Is it a standard fee for all packages or does it vary depending on the package's content or value?\n\nI'm also curious about the \"Special Order\" registration of my package. What does that mean exactly?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nHanna"
