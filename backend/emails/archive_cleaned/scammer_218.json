        "body": "Hello Miss Lynda Green,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am quite surprised to hear about this unclaimed fund, as I was not aware of it before. Could you please provide me with more details? How did my name come up in the United Nations' general assembly meeting? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what these funds are for and why they have been held up all these years? It would be helpful if you could explain the process that led to this discovery.\n\nI'm sorry but I can't provide my mobile number, passport copy or personal email address at this time. However, I am interested in learning more about this situation.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
