It's truly heartbreaking to hear about the struggles that innocent people are facing there. I'm really sorry to hear about your current circumstances.\n\nCould you please tell me more about how these donations are being used? Are they directly converted into food, water, and medication for the people in need? Also, is there an organization or group that oversees these donations?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nTonya"
