Can you please provide more details about the payment? What is it for and who is the sender?\n2. Why do I need to make a fee payment before transferring the funds? Is there any specific reason for this?\n3. Could you explain how the online account works? How can I ensure the security of my funds during the transfer process?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKaren"
