        "body": "Hello Barrister Peter Mbah ESQ,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing! It's not every day that one receives a message from the attorney to the Senate committee of Nigeria.\n\nI'm curious about this ATM card payment system you mentioned. How does it work exactly? And why has my contract file ended up on the finance manager's desk? \n\nAlso, could you please clarify what you mean by \"lack of and not fulfilling the giving\"? I'm afraid I didn't quite understand that part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about this!\n\nBest wishes,\nLucy"
