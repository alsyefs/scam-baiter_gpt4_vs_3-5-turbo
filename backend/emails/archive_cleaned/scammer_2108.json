        "body": "Dear Friend,\r\n\r\nI am Phillips Cole, I am a staff in a pharmaceutical company in the UK.\r\nOriginally from Scotland UK and working in London UK.\r\n I have a contract opportunity from our pharmaceutical company that pays\r\nits suppliers to deliver raw material for their production needs.\r\n\r\nCan you be able handle such? or bring a capable hand to handle such a\r\ncontract and earn 10% of the profit share?\r\n\r\nor you handle the contract directly and we share the net profit at 60 /40 %\r\nratio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this email is to explore the possibility of utilizing you or\r\nyour company as a replacement for our current supplier, who is demanding\r\nexorbitant profits for the supply of raw materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are seeking a new supplier for \"Lactozora Herbs\", which\r\nare integral to the production of human fertility treatment and sexually\r\ntransmitted treatment medicine.\r\n\r\nOur buying entity, a major pharmaceutical company based in the UK, is keen\r\nto find a reliable supplier for this essential raw material. The source of\r\nthese herbs is a reputable farmer located in the USA. The farmer currently\r\nsells the \"Lactozora Herbs\" at a reasonable price of\r\n$870 per sachet, while our purchasing company is prepared to buy them at\r\n$1200 per sachet.\r\n\r\nIf you express interest in pursuing this business opportunity, I will\r\ngladly provide you with the contact details of the farmer. The potential\r\nvolume of orders from the pharmaceutical company ranges from 150,000 to\r\n200,000 sachets, signifying a substantial and lucrative partnership for you\r\nor your company. Upon successful execution of the contract, we would expect\r\nboth parties to share in the legitimate profits, given that I am the one\r\npresenting this opportunity to you.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the raw material in question has extensive use\r\nbeyond the production of fertility and sexually transmitted treatment\r\nmedicines. It serves as a valuable ingredient in other antiviral drugs,\r\nsuch as Azidothymidine. Interestingly, the current supplier has been known\r\nto acquire the product from the same source while masquerading as the\r\noriginal farmer.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was made when the farmer's contact details were\r\ninadvertently included on the Airway bill.\r\n\r\nThe purchasing company is willing to provide advance payment once the\r\ncontract has been signed, allowing you to supply the products after the\r\nnecessary tests and samples have been provided. Your role in this\r\npartnership would involve assuming the responsibilities of the\r\nfarmer/supplier, all while ensuring that the purchasing pharmaceutical\r\ncompany remains unaware of the direct link between the farmer and yourself.\r\n\r\nThis strategic maneuver will ensure the protection of our business\r\ninterests and guarantee a fair share of the profits, which the previous\r\nsupplier has unscrupulously monopolized.\r\n\r\nNo specialized skills or prior experience are required to handle this\r\ncontract supply. You can efficiently manage this transaction from the\r\ncomfort of your own home or country.\r\n\r\nTo proceed, a profit share Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) will be\r\nsigned, outlining the distribution of profits. As the insider partner who\r\nbrought this opportunity to you, I propose a favorable ratio of 60% for you\r\nto manage the transaction and 40% for myself.\r\n\r\nShould you accept this proposition, I will provide you with detailed\r\nprocedural advice, guiding you step by step through the process. After\r\nreading your positive response, we can proceed with signing the profit\r\nshare agreement and delve into further details.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this unique opportunity. I am confident that by\r\npartnering together, we can forge a lucrative and mutually beneficial\r\nbusiness relationship.\r\n\r\n I eagerly await your response.\r\n\r\nWarm regards,\r\n\r\nPhillips Cole."

        "body": "Dear Ella,\r\nThank you for expressing your interest in my supply contract proposal. I\r\nwould like to provide you with further details regarding this opportunity.\r\n\r\nTo clarify, this business involves the contract supply of raw materials\r\nwith the intention of earning legitimate profit. It is important to note\r\nthat as an employee of my current company, I am unable to act as a\r\ncontractor supplier to the same company.\r\n\r\nThis is an open business venture with no hidden agenda. Transparency is\r\nkey, and you will have full visibility into all aspects of the process as\r\nwe move forward.\r\n\r\nThe contract involves the supply of Lactozora Herbs raw materials to an end\r\nuser company. Currently, the existing supplier is obtaining the raw\r\nmaterials from the original farmer in the USA, whom our company believes is\r\nthe genuine producer. The current supplier is providing the materials at a\r\nrate of $1300 per kg, while the original producer in the USA is selling at\r\nless than $1000 per kg.\r\n\r\nIn order to make your price offer more competitive and attractive to secure\r\nthe contract opportunity, we suggest offering a lower price of $1,200 per\r\nkg to our company.\r\n\r\nOnce trust is established, the company will arrange payment of 50% or 100%\r\nto you upon receipt of mandatory laboratory test samples to assess the\r\nquality of your raw material product as a new supplier.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that the Lactozora Herbs are used in the production of\r\nhuman fertility treatment and sexually transmitted treatment medicine. As\r\nsuch, there is a high demand for these materials, making this business\r\nventure potentially lucrative.\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration, I have chosen to seek out a trustworthy\r\nindividual to take on this supply contract. The selected individual will\r\nhave the opportunity to share in the profits generated from this business\r\nventure. This is why I have approached you with this opportunity.\r\n\r\nYour role as the new supplier will involve direct dealings with the farmer\r\nand ensuring that the products are packaged or labeled under your company's\r\nname.\r\n\r\nTo give you an idea of the profit potential, if you were to multiply your\r\n$330 profit per sachet by 20,000 kgs, you would obtain the profit from the\r\nfirst 20,000 sachets supplied to our company.\r\n\r\nAs an incentive for your involvement, we will share the profits on a ratio\r\nof 60% for you and 40% for me, given that I have facilitated your access to\r\nthis privilegedD business opportunity.\r\n\r\nIt is important to act swiftly to secure this contract before other\r\nsuppliers emerge from alternative sources.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in proceeding, I kindly request the following\r\npersonal details in order to draft a Trust/Profit Share Agreement:\r\n\r\n1. Your full name\r\n2. Your full contact/permanent address\r\n3. Your profession/occupation within your company\r\n4. Your company's name and address\r\n5. A valid copy of your identification\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce I receive the above details, I will send you a draft copy of the\r\nProfit Share Agreement for your review. This will allow you to decide\r\nwhether you wish to proceed or not. The agreement will protect my interest\r\nin offering you the opportunity to supply the product to the pharmaceutical\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to move forward, I will provide you with a draft sample of\r\nthe Supply Application Letter. This letter will need to be addressed to our\r\ncompany and officially apply for the supply of the Lactozora Herbs.\r\n\r\nRest assured, this business venture will always be mutually beneficial as\r\nlong as there is a foundation of trust between us.\r\n\r\nPlease note that once the profit share Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is\r\nsigned, I will provide you with direct contact details for the purchasing\r\ndepartment of the pharmaceutical company, as well as the farmer's contact\r\ninformation. I will also supply you with a sample copy of the supplier\r\napplication letter to avoid any mistakes on your part.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering this opportunity. I look forward to receiving\r\nyour personal details and establishing a prosperous partnership.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPhillips Cole.\r\n\r\n*N/B:*\r\n\r\n*The summary answers to your questions;*\r\n*a. I ask for 40% because I am the one bringing out this opportunity to you\r\nand I am also going to play a confidential role by providing you with all\r\nthe details you shall need to secure the contract and deliver the contract\r\nwithout making a mistake as a first time supplier.*\r\n\r\n*b. You will take 60% because you are the one to handle the contract as the\r\nfront man, manage the process, deal with the end user and the farmer as the\r\ncontractor. Your role will be very crucial to the success as the main\r\nperson the companies will be dealing with.*\r\n\r\n*If you are bringing in another person to handle the contract as a broker,\r\nyou will then be compensated with 10% of the net profit. *\r\n\r\n*c. The Farmers contact will be released after we both sign the Trust and\r\nProfit share MOU. This is normal to protect our mutual interest without\r\nbetrayal of trust.*\r\nattached are the pictures of the raw material.\r\n\r\nClarification answers to business operation questions below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion\r\n\r\nWhat is the name of the raw material?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswer; The raw material is a herbal plant processed into herbal powder by\r\nthe farmer/producer and named it Lactozora which was introduced to our\r\ncompany by an  Indian Supplier that claims to be the original farmer as I\r\nhave explained in my previous emails to you. I hereby once again attach the\r\nsample pictures to you to see the name on the product picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Question*\r\n\r\nI trust this missive finds you in the zenith of well-being and prosperity.\r\nI am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the intriguing business\r\nproposal you recently extended to me. Your sagacious insights and\r\ncomprehensive approach have not gone unnoticed, and I find myself\r\nenthralled by the prospects encapsulated within your proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my ardent desire to gain a more profound comprehension of the\r\nintricacies entwined within this venture, I venture to kindly solicit\r\nfurther elucidation. Your erudite elucidation on the following aspects\r\nwould undoubtedly illuminate my understanding and foster a more judicious\r\nevaluation of the proposed collaboration:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A Detailed Exegesis of the Core Business Concept: I beseech your\r\nindulgence in expounding upon the fundamental tenets of the business model,\r\nincluding its overarching goals and the modus operandi envisaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer:*  This is a simple legitimate sales business to supply herbal raw\r\nmaterials to the end user pharmaceutical company that needs such raw\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               I need a business minded competent person to handle this\r\ncontract to supply the raw materials at a profit margin to earn legitimate\r\nprofit from the contract and share the profit with me as the person that\r\nintroduced such a business opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              I am working with this end user company and I am not\r\npermitted to become a supplier to my employers. The person I am introducing\r\nthis business to will have an advantage to succeed with the information I\r\nshall be providing to avoid mistakes that could lead to failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              As explained in my 2nd email, the Indian supplier is sourcing\r\nthe raw material herbs from a farmer in the USA and claiming to be the\r\nfarmer in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Since I discovered this revelation that he is not the\r\noriginal farmer and he is just a supplier that sources from the original\r\nsource to earn massive profit,\r\n\r\n              I decided to get a replacement for him to enable me to get a\r\nshare from that huge profit he is taking alone as a greedy supplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              I shall give the original farmer and the end user company\r\ncontact to any one that is able to sign the Trust and profit share\r\nagreement with me to guarantee my interest and confidential participation\r\nin such a contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Details below are required from such a competent, transparent\r\nand reliable person.\r\n\r\n              1. Your address\r\n              2. Phone number\r\n              3. Any means of identification copy\r\n              4. Your company name\r\n              5. Direct phone and whatsapp number for easier communication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Question*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Financial Dynamics and Investment Parameters: A nuanced delineation of\r\nthe financial facets, encompassing capitalization requirements, projected\r\nreturns, and the risk mitigation strategies in place, would be most\r\ninvaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer: *\r\n\r\n                  The new contract will need to do the following to secure\r\nthe contract and take over from the old supplier.\r\n\r\na.     To send an application letter to the end user pharmaceutical company\r\nin the UK with an offer to supply the raw material at a very competitive\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb.     The only capital required here is for the normal contract approval\r\npursuance expenses, such as company registration cost if you have not\r\nregistered your company before now to apply for the contract. Any existing\r\ncompany name with a bank account can be used to apply for the contract and\r\nexecute such a contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc.     To procure samples from the original farmer, labelled such samples\r\nin your name that will be delivered to the pharmaceutical company required\r\nfor laboratory mandatory test before the pharmaceutical company can sign a\r\nprocurement contract with your company and release payment to your company\r\nto execute the contract supply delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nd.      We are expected to earn 6 million USD in one contract slot if\r\nsuccessfully executed.\r\n\r\n              This is the simple breakdown to that expectation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne.     The farmer sells the raw material be sachet at INCLUSIVE OF SHIPPING\r\nAND\r\n\r\n                LOGISTICS $950\r\n\r\n You are to sell or supply to the pharmaceutical company at $1200 multiply\r\nby 25,000 sachets  is 30,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are to supply a minimum 25,000 sachets. 250 net profit multiplied by\r\n25,000  sachets is 6,250,000 As a first time supply, they will not approve\r\nabove 30,000 kgs to a first time supplier. You can get a higher contract\r\nsupply slot after the first contract is delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         The risk mitigation process has to do with the following caution\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n             Protection of information about this contract from person’s\r\nnot concerned or 3rd parties that has no business with our contract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Making sure my discussions with you are confidential, the company\r\nwill not give you any contract if they know you have an insider working\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Respecting the terms of Profit share agreement\r\nsigned between us, failure to respect such will block the way for future\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Making sure the raw materials are sourced only from\r\nthe original source that has been supplying the old contractor from India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Making sure that you do not try to maximize profit\r\nby adulterating the original product to increase quantity and enhance\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Question:*\r\n\r\n3. Operational Framework and Timelines: A comprehensive overview of the\r\nenvisaged operational framework, coupled with projected timelines for key\r\nmilestones, would greatly enhance my ability to envisage the trajectory of\r\nthis collaborative endeavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer:*\r\n\r\na.      Each contract takes 2 months to complete due to delivery methods\r\nthat have to do with air cargo freight\r\n\r\nb.     The contract, application, contract signing, contract payment takes\r\na maximum of 30 days and the delivery of the goods is expected to take 30\r\ndays or less\r\n\r\nc.      The contract time frame depends on how fast you are able to act on\r\ninstructions and directives by making provisions of requirements and\r\ndetails as already explained above.\r\n\r\nd.     Operational framework starts with signing the trust and profit share\r\nagreement with me and doing the needful as already explained above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Question:*\r\n\r\n4. Risk Mitigation Strategies: In cognizance of the volatile nature of\r\ncontemporary business landscapes, a discerning elucidation on the\r\nstrategies delineated for risk mitigation would provide solace and fortify\r\nmy confidence in the proposed venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer: *\r\n\r\n  The contract opportunity demands you to develop a positive mindset and\r\nnever to mistake this offer as a scam because this is a 100%\r\nlegitimate business to earn legitimate profit by dealing with the farmer to\r\nsource the raw materials and selling to the end user at a profit margin to\r\nearn legitimate profit in business. The raw material is simply a herbal\r\nplant that is not unlawful to buy from the producers and sell to the end\r\nuser pharmaceutical company. It is called contract supply because the\r\nsupplier receives payment from the end user company after they have\r\ncomplied with contract payment demands to receive payment for the contract\r\nand supply the product. This only makes the difference between the regular\r\nbuy and sell regular trading."

        "body": "Dear Phillips Cole,\n\nThank you for providing me with more information about the supply contract proposal. I appreciate your transparency and willingness to share details about the business venture.\n\nI understand that the raw material in question is called Lactozora Herbs, which is a herbal plant processed into herbal powder by the farmer producer. It is used in the production of human fertility treatment and sexually treatment medicine, making it a high-demand product.\n\nYou mentioned that the current supplier is obtaining the raw materials from the original farmer in the USA, but they are selling it at a higher price compared to what the original producer is offering. To secure the contract, you suggest offering a lower price per kg to your company.\n\nI also appreciate your explanation of my role as the new supplier. It seems that I would be responsible for direct dealings with the farmer and ensuring that the products are packaged or labeled under my company's name. This sounds like an important responsibility in managing this business venture.\n\nIn terms of financial dynamics and investment parameters, you mentioned that there are no significant capital requirements other than normal contract approval expenses. The projected returns seem promising, with potential earnings of millions of USD in one contract slot if executed successfully.\n\nRegarding timelines, it appears that each contract takes months to complete due to delivery methods, but the contract signing and payment process should take a maximum of days. The delivery of goods is expected to take days or less.\n\nLastly, I appreciate your emphasis on trust and respect between us as we move forward with this venture. I understand that failure to respect our agreement could block future contracts.\n\nOverall, I am intrigued by this opportunity and would like to learn more about how we can proceed. However, before sharing any personal details or making any commitments, I would like to review any agreements or contracts you have mentioned. Could you please provide me with a draft copy of both the Profit Share Agreement and Supplier Letter for my review?\n\nThank you again for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nElla"

I hereby once again attach the\r\nsample pictures to you to see the name on the product picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Question*\r\n\r\nI trust this missive finds you in the zenith of well-being and prosperity.\r\nI am writing to express my sincere appreciation for the intriguing business\r\nproposal you recently extended to me. Your sagacious insights and\r\ncomprehensive approach have not gone unnoticed, and I find myself\r\nenthralled by the prospects encapsulated within your proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my ardent desire to gain a more profound comprehension of the\r\nintricacies entwined within this venture, I venture to kindly solicit\r\nfurther elucidation. Your erudite elucidation on the following aspects\r\nwould undoubtedly illuminate my understanding and foster a more judicious\r\nevaluation of the proposed collaboration:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A Detailed Exegesis of the Core Business Concept: I beseech your\r\nindulgence in expounding upon the fundamental tenets of the business model,\r\nincluding its overarching goals and the modus operandi envisaged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer:*  This is a simple legitimate sales business to supply herbal raw\r\nmaterials to the end user pharmaceutical company that needs such raw\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               I need a business minded competent person to handle this\r\ncontract to supply the raw materials at a profit margin to earn legitimate\r\nprofit from the contract and share the profit with me as the person that\r\nintroduced such a business opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              I am working with this end user company and I am not\r\npermitted to become a supplier to my employers. The person I am introducing\r\nthis business to will have an advantage to succeed with the information I\r\nshall be providing to avoid mistakes that could lead to failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              As explained in my 2nd email, the Indian supplier is sourcing\r\nthe raw material herbs from a farmer in the USA and claiming to be the\r\nfarmer in India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Since I discovered this revelation that he is not the\r\noriginal farmer and he is just a supplier that sources from the original\r\nsource to earn massive profit,\r\n\r\n              I decided to get a replacement for him to enable me to get a\r\nshare from that huge profit he is taking alone as a greedy supplier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              I shall give the original farmer and the end user company\r\ncontact to any one that is able to sign the Trust and profit share\r\nagreement with me to guarantee my interest and confidential participation\r\nin such a contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              Details below are required from such a competent, transparent\r\nand reliable person.\r\n\r\n              1. Your address\r\n              2. Phone number\r\n              3. Any means of identification copy\r\n              4. Your company name\r\n              5. Direct phone and whatsapp number for easier communication\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Question*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Financial Dynamics and Investment Parameters: A nuanced delineation of\r\nthe financial facets, encompassing capitalization requirements, projected\r\nreturns, and the risk mitigation strategies in place, would be most\r\ninvaluable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer: *\r\n\r\n                  The new contract will need to do the following to secure\r\nthe contract and take over from the old supplier.\r\n\r\na.     To send an application letter to the end user pharmaceutical company\r\nin the UK with an offer to supply the raw material at a very competitive\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nb.     The only capital required here is for the normal contract approval\r\npursuance expenses, such as company registration cost if you have not\r\nregistered your company before now to apply for the contract. Any existing\r\ncompany name with a bank account can be used to apply for the contract and\r\nexecute such a contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nc.     To procure samples from the original farmer, labelled such samples\r\nin your name that will be delivered to the pharmaceutical company required\r\nfor laboratory mandatory test before the pharmaceutical company can sign a\r\nprocurement contract with your company and release payment to your company\r\nto execute the contract supply delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nd.      We are expected to earn 6 million USD in one contract slot if\r\nsuccessfully executed.\r\n\r\n              This is the simple breakdown to that expectation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ne.     The farmer sells the raw material be sachet at INCLUSIVE OF SHIPPING\r\nAND\r\n\r\n                LOGISTICS $950\r\n\r\n You are to sell or supply to the pharmaceutical company at $1200 multiply\r\nby 25,000 sachets  is 30,000,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are to supply a minimum 25,000 sachets. 250 net profit multiplied by\r\n25,000  sachets is 6,250,000 As a first time supply, they will not approve\r\nabove 30,000 kgs to a first time supplier. You can get a higher contract\r\nsupply slot after the first contract is delivered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         The risk mitigation process has to do with the following caution\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n             Protection of information about this contract from person’s\r\nnot concerned or 3rd parties that has no business with our contract\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Making sure my discussions with you are confidential, the company\r\nwill not give you any contract if they know you have an insider working\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Respecting the terms of Profit share agreement\r\nsigned between us, failure to respect such will block the way for future\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Making sure the raw materials are sourced only from\r\nthe original source that has been supplying the old contractor from India.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Making sure that you do not try to maximize profit\r\nby adulterating the original product to increase quantity and enhance\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Question:*\r\n\r\n3. Operational Framework and Timelines: A comprehensive overview of the\r\nenvisaged operational framework, coupled with projected timelines for key\r\nmilestones, would greatly enhance my ability to envisage the trajectory of\r\nthis collaborative endeavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer:*\r\n\r\na.      Each contract takes 2 months to complete due to delivery methods\r\nthat have to do with air cargo freight\r\n\r\nb.     The contract, application, contract signing, contract payment takes\r\na maximum of 30 days and the delivery of the goods is expected to take 30\r\ndays or less\r\n\r\nc.      The contract time frame depends on how fast you are able to act on\r\ninstructions and directives by making provisions of requirements and\r\ndetails as already explained above.\r\n\r\nd.     Operational framework starts with signing the trust and profit share\r\nagreement with me and doing the needful as already explained above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Question:*\r\n\r\n4. Risk Mitigation Strategies: In cognizance of the volatile nature of\r\ncontemporary business landscapes, a discerning elucidation on the\r\nstrategies delineated for risk mitigation would provide solace and fortify\r\nmy confidence in the proposed venture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Answer: *\r\n\r\n  The contract opportunity demands you to develop a positive mindset and\r\nnever to mistake this offer as a scam because this is a 100%\r\nlegitimate business to earn legitimate profit by dealing with the farmer to\r\nsource the raw materials and selling to the end user at a profit margin to\r\nearn legitimate profit in business. The raw material is simply a herbal\r\nplant that is not unlawful to buy from the producers and sell to the end\r\nuser pharmaceutical company. It is called contract supply because the\r\nsupplier receives payment from the end user company after they have\r\ncomplied with contract payment demands to receive payment for the contract\r\nand supply the product. This only makes the difference between the regular\r\nbuy and sell regular trading."
