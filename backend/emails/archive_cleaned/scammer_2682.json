        "body": "Hello Mr. Para Jefferson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the Western Union Team. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the situation regarding my funds. I understand that there have been some issues with scams and fake officials, and I'm glad to hear that you are concerned about resolving this matter.\n\nI must admit, though, that I am a bit confused about the Funds Merit Claims Permit you mentioned. Could you please provide more information on what exactly this permit is and why it is necessary for me to receive my funds? I want to make sure I fully understand the process before moving forward.\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned a Western Union Gold ATM Debit Card that is ready to be delivered to me. How does this card work? Will it allow me to access my funds directly?\n\nThank you again for your assistance in this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSusan"
