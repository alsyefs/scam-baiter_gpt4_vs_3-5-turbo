What exactly are these processing charges for? And why can't they be deducted from the fund?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"the federal high court here will alert the United State Bureau and also your state police\"? I'm not sure I understand this part.\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about this Ria Money Transfer or Apple card method? How does it work and why is it necessary?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRod"
