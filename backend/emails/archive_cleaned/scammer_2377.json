        "body": "Hello Mr. Steven James,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite surprising! I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, contrary to what this Scow Kendel person has been telling you.\n\nI'm curious about this approved ATM Cash Card payment of Million United States. Could you please provide more details about it? How was it approved and why was it assigned to me?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the Banker's Courier Service? How does it work and how secure is it?\n\nAs for the delivery fees, could you clarify how much exactly I need to send? And why through Ria money transfer specifically?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
