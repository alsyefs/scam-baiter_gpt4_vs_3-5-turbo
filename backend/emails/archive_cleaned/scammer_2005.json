        "body": "Dear Mrs. Jessica Felicia Jeffrey,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and sharing your story. I'm sorry to hear about your health condition, and I hope you are receiving the necessary care and support during this difficult time.\n\nI appreciate your trust in me and considering me for such an important task. However, before we proceed further, I have a few questions that I would like to ask:\n\n1. Can you provide more details about the security company where the funds are currently deposited? How can we ensure that the funds will be released safely?\n\n2. What specific work of God do you have in mind for these funds? Are there any particular projects or organizations that you would like to support?\n\n3. Could you please introduce me to your lawyer so that I can discuss the legal aspects of this matter with them?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of the situation, I will be able to make a more informed decision regarding my involvement. Thank you again for considering me for this opportunity.\n\nMay God bless you as well.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
