        "body": "Hello Meier,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. It's quite a lot to take in, but I'm trying my best to understand everything.\n\nIt seems like there are two methods of payment available - by Check or ATM card. Could you please explain a bit more about these options? For instance, how secure is the ATM card method? And if I choose the check option, how long would it typically take for the check to clear at my bank?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that there's a fee involved with DHL for package delivery. Could you clarify what this fee covers exactly? Is it just for shipping or are there other services included?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about this Code of Conduct that was issued? What does it mean and how should I use it?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nTina"
