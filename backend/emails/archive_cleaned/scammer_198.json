I'm interested in learning more about this online fund and the activation fee you mentioned.\n\nCould you please provide me with some additional information about the activation fee? How much is it exactly? And how does it work? You mentioned that the fee will be credited to my online bank account, can you explain how that process works?\n\nI also noticed that you mentioned employment details. Could you clarify why those are necessary for opening an online bank account?
