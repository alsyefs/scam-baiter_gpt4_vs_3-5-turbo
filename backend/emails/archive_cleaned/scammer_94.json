I don't recall instructing anyone named Jeff Douglas to claim any ATM Payment on my behalf. It's interesting that he's from Minnesota, USA - I've always wanted to visit there.\n\nCould you tell me more about how this situation came about? How did Jeff Douglas come into the picture and why does he have my name associated with him?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAlice"
