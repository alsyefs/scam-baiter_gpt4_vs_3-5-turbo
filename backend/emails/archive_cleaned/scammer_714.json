My name is Mrs. Elizabeth Charles, a widow from Tennessee, United States. I am presently writing to you from my sickbed because I have been fighting cancer for over 5 years and the doctor says I have a few months left.\nI want to entrust my money $15.8 Million dollars to your care for charity purposes and crave your indulgence as a concerned individual to help use my money for charity and also assist the poor with less privileged in the society, so reply for more information as I'm not always online due to my health and my late husband's brother wants me dead so that he will claim all my late husband and I worked for.\nI will tell you more about myself and what you need to do with the money once you receive it. Give me your word that you will not betray my trust, so that I will furnish you with more details about the Funds. Please reply now as my health is pretty bad, itâ€™s urgent and very important you keep this email confidential.\nHenceforth kindly reply to my personal email: \nelizabethcharles3042@gmail.com\nHave a blessed day and do not forget to pray for me.\nRemain Blessed\nMrs. Elizabeth Charles\nFrom Tennessee, United States. \nPersonal email: \nelizabethcharles3042@gmail.com\n "
