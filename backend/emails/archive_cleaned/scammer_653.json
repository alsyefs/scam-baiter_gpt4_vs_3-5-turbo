It's not every day that one hears about such a large sum of money.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some details in your message. You mentioned DMT several times - could you please clarify what DMT stands for? Also, it seems like some parts of the text are missing or unclear. Could you kindly provide more information?\n\nAs for the details you asked for, I'm afraid I can't share them at this point as we're still getting to know each other and discussing this matter. But rest assured, your identity is safe with me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRuth"
