It's quite a surprise, I must say! \n\nYou mentioned that the first batch of my card contains US Million, could you please clarify how much exactly? Also, it would be great if you could provide more details about this payment task force and its operations.\n\nRegarding the delivery fee of US for DHL Delivering Company, is there any other way to cover this cost? Maybe it can be deducted from the total fund?\n\nI'm sorry but I won't be able to send a scanned copy of my ID due to personal reasons. However, I assure you that all the information provided by me will be accurate.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJulian"
