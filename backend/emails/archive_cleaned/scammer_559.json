Can you please provide more information about the payment processing fee? What is it specifically for and why is it necessary?\n\nI appreciate your assurance that this is not a scam, but I would like to know more about the steps involved in receiving the funds. Can you explain the process in detail?\n\nAlso, could you clarify why the payout bank has reduced the processing charges? Is there a specific reason for this reduction?\n\nLastly, can you provide any references or testimonials from previous clients who have successfully received their funds through your services? It would help build my trust in this process.\n\nThank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonald"
