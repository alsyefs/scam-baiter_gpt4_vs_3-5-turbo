I am determined to fulfill my last wish on this earth\r\nwhich is why I will be trusting and believing your sincerity to appropriate\r\nthis task accordingly. As a servant of the living God, I will want you to\r\ntake your time and pray about this, and re-assure me that you will use this\r\nfund as directed, because the use of this fund for Humanitarian assistance\r\nand charity will be the only way my spirit will be at rest.\r\n\r\nI would have to write an authorization letter to my bank here in Thailand,\r\ninstructing them to transfer the funds into your bank account. You are\r\ntherefore requested to provide me with the below information, so that I can\r\nsend an authorization letter to the Thailand bank instructing them to\r\nrelease the $5,500,000 Dollars into your bank account for humanitarian and\r\ncharity work.\r\n\r\n1. Your Full Name:\r\n2. Your complete address:\r\n3. Your age:\r\n4. Your occupation and position:\r\n5. A scan copy of any form of your identification:\r\n6. Your direct telephone number:\r\n7. Your bank account information to transfer the funds:\r\n\r\nOnce I receive the above data from you I will prepare a funds transfer\r\nauthorization letter with your information and forward it to my bank to\r\nenable the bank to confirm you as the beneficiary and transfer the funds\r\ninto your bank account accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that you send to me the above information as quickly\r\nas possible because I am scheduled to go for the cancerous lymph nodes\r\nremoval surgical operation in a few days, and I would like to conclude with\r\nall necessary documents and forward the funds transfer Authorization to my\r\nbank before proceeding with the surgery. In the case of my absence, my\r\nassigned lady nurse Ms. Kim Chan, will guide you on what to do to enable my\r\nbank to complete the funds transfer to your bank account. I beg you to be\r\npraying for me for a successful surgical operation in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nI pray that God will give you more anointing and wisdom to handle this\r\nproject to the Glory of God. Amen.\r\n\r\nThanks and may God bless us all.\r\n\r\nMy late husband was a trading merchant businessman in Thailand before his\r\ndeath, so we lived in Thailand for some time before his demise and my\r\ncancer diagnosis.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nMrs. Miho Oshima"

        "body": "Dear Beloved Sister Marina,\r\n\r\nI sent you the below email message earlier today along with a copy of my\r\npassport. Did you receive it?\r\n\r\nGreetings, Dear Marina.\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for your kind consideration.\r\nI am Mrs. Miho Oshima , I am 75 years old, I attach copy of my passport on\r\nthis email for you to be sure who you are communicating with. I am\r\ncurrently living in Thailand where I am undergoing medical treatment for\r\nthroat cancer which unfortunately has spread to my lymph nodes and some\r\nother parts of my body. I was married to Late Mr. Kobayashi Oshima from\r\nNagasaki who died four years ago, and I inherited the family's business, my\r\nhusband and I were married for 17 years without a child, so I am childless\r\nand have no one to inherit my estate when I am gone. I prayed to God asking\r\nhim for direction on who to donate the funds to before contacting you, and\r\nI want you to know that I am not asking you for any money, rather I seek\r\nfor your trust and honesty in distributing the donation money to poor\r\nChildren like motherless, destitute homeless people. I have also donated to\r\ncharity organizations in Thailand, Africa and South American countries, but\r\nthis time I want to donate the sum of, ( a total sum of $5.5 million USD)\r\nto you as an individual to help distribute it to the homeless children and\r\ndestitute around you.\r\n\r\nRecently, My health has deteriorated, and my doctors have informed me that\r\nI have a few months to live, and as a result of shock, I was hit by a\r\npartial stroke, which affected my ability to walk, talk or do anything on\r\nmy own. Having known my condition I decided to search for a God Fearing\r\nindividual whom I can (WILL/DONATE) the funds to enable him/her utilize\r\nthis money the way I am going to instruct here. I want an individual that\r\nwill use this money to help the poor in the religious houses, orphanage\r\nhomes, widows and the destitute. I took the decision to donate this money\r\nto you because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money, and\r\nconsidering my ill health, I had no choice but to give the money out for\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nI sincerely request for your assistance in this humanitarian work. I will\r\nsend a funds transfer request letter to my bank instructing them to\r\ntransfer the total sum of Five Million, five Hundred Thousand Dollars into\r\nyour bank account, then you will use Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand\r\nUnited States Dollars to help the following people: Motherless babies,\r\nWidows, Disable and the destitute, Helping the poor in religious houses.\r\nThe remaining One Million United States Dollars will be for you as a reward\r\nfor your good work, and I need you to promise me that you will sincerely\r\nuse the money as I mentioned above to carry out the humanitarian project.\r\nNote that there are no risks involved because my late husband acquired the\r\nmoney through legal means, and the donations funds transfer process will be\r\nfollowed legally.\r\n\r\nPresently I am taking treatments at the Isolated specialist cancer hospital\r\nhere in Bangkok, Thailand. I don’t know how long I will be alive, but I am\r\npraying that God should help me.  I am very weak these days and talk very\r\nslowly. I write emails with the help of my assigned lady nurse here Ms. Kim\r\nChan. She is a trusted lady whom I have known in recent years, she is the\r\nperson that helps me access and write emails, sometimes responding to your\r\nemails might be difficult if she's unavailable. I promised God that all my\r\ndonations will be done quietly without any publicity, kindly respect my\r\nwish and handle the whole process confidential, as I do not want any\r\npraises from anyone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I hear from you, I will give you further details on what you are\r\nrequired to provide to enable the funds transfer to your bank account.\r\n\r\nMay the almighty God bless you.\r\n\nBest regards.\r\nMrs. Miho Oshima"
