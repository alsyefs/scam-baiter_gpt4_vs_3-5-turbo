        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an interesting message. I'm a bit surprised to be contacted by the FBI, but it's good to know that you're looking out for my interests.\n\nI understand from your message that there's an ATM VISA Card worth a significant amount of money in my name and that I need to sign a Tax clearance to claim it. That sounds like quite an opportunity!\n\nHowever, before we proceed further, could you please clarify a few things for me? \n\n1. How did this ATM VISA Card come into existence? \n2. Why was it sent by the Supreme Court Of The United States?\n3. What exactly does signing the Tax clearance entail?\n\nI'm also curious about the fee you mentioned. Could you provide more details about what this fee is for and why it's necessary?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRose"
