        "body": "Hello Diplomat Charles Thomas,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. It's quite a surprise to hear from you, and I must say, your email has certainly piqued my interest. \n\nIt's wonderful to know that the United Nations has recognized my efforts towards mankind. However, I'm a bit confused about the package you mentioned. Could you please provide more details about it? What does it contain? Why was it sent to me specifically?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about your stay in Leeds with Mr Andrew Coding. How did you two meet? Is he also involved in this delivery process?\n\nI appreciate your effort and look forward to hearing more about this exciting opportunity.\n\nBest wishes,\nTimothy"
