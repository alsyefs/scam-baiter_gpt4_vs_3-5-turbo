        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the Office of African Union. I appreciate you sharing this information with me. It's concerning to hear about the high rate of internet scammers and fraudsters in Africa.\n\nI understand that you have arrested a significant number of scammers and recovered a substantial amount of money from them. That must have been quite an operation. I'm curious, how did you manage to track down these scammers?\n\nYou mentioned that my email address was found in their address books. I find that quite surprising, as I've always been cautious about online security. Can you provide more details on how my email address ended up on their list?\n\nRegarding the payment of USD to victims, could you please explain how this process works? How do I go about contacting Mr. Folashodun Shonubi for my payment? Is there any documentation or verification required?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAddie"
