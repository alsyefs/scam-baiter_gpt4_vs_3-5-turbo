        "body": "   Urgent Business Proposal.\nI am Mr. Desmond Campbell, I work with the investor's center of the\nLondon stock exchange group Plc. We have for some years now, been\ndealing with some unclaimed shares running to the tune of 8.4 Million\nThousand Pounds and recently my boss secretly decided to sell it off\nwith the intention that the two of us will make use of the fund for\ninvestment outside the stock house.\nAn American investor has paid for the unclaimed shares in Dollars and\nthe cash has been received and saved in China Citic Bank (CCB) for\nonward movement outside the Country. But unfortunately, my boss passed\naway two months ago, and the family has read his last testament (WILL)\nwithout mentioning anything about this cash deposited in China Citic\nBank (CCB).\nSo at this point, I was the only person that knew this deal and where\nthis money was. But,  since I cannot do it alone, I contacted my boss\nwife and told her all that transpired while her husband was alive and\nI am the only trusted partner who knows about this money because of\nthis, she has given me the go ahead order to make sure I get a trusted\nperson  overseas who will receive this fund and share it, so that her\nfamily will make use of their own share of the money to complete her\nhusbandâ€™s intention and his soul will rest in peace.\nThe total amount in Dollars is US$10,636,352.96 and this amount is\nstill available in China Citic Bank (CCB). Reply via my private email:\n( \nmrdesmondcampbell001@gmail.com\n ), while a legal practitioner will\nuse these details to get a legal permit for you to receive this cash\noutside this Country for our sharing. You will be given 30% out of the\ntotal sum.\nYour cooperation is highly expected to help this widow and her children.\nYours truly,\nMr. Desmond Campbell\nEmail:mrdesmondcampbell001@gmail.com  "

        "body": "Hello Mr. Desmond Campbell,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this urgent business proposal. I must say, it sounds quite intriguing. I'm sorry to hear about the passing of your boss and the situation surrounding the unclaimed shares.\n\nI would be interested to know more about how this process works and what my role would be in helping the widow and her children. Could you please provide me with some additional details? How exactly would we go about receiving the funds from China Citic Bank CCB? And what legal permits are required for me to receive the cash outside of the country?\n\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBradley"
