        "body": "Dear Dr Mrs Rita Smith,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding this matter. I must admit that I am a bit confused about the situation. I have not instructed anyone named Mr. Timmy Cross or any Florida group Ltd to receive any payment on my behalf. This is the first time I am hearing about it.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about this payment and why someone would claim to be acting on my behalf? I want to make sure that everything is legitimate before taking any further action.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by indicating the mode of payment suitable to me? What are the available options?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter and look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMonique"
