        "body": "  Attention: Beneficiary ,\nI am Dr. Mark Williams Head of Inspection Unit United Nations\nInspection Kennedy Airport (NY).\nDuring our investigation, I discovered An\nabandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was\ntransferred from Southwest Florida International (Florida) to our\nfacility here in NY, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum\nof money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 65kg each.\nThe consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly\ndeclared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as a personal\neffect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping\nAgent or confiscation by the relevant authorities.\nBy my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. They\nare still left in the airport storage facility till today. The\nConsignments, like I said, are two metal trunk boxes weighing about\n65kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective\ncapacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment\nincluding your name and email on the official document from the United\nNations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal\neffects/classified document is still available with us. As it stands\nnow, you have to reconfirm your\n1.full name,\n2.Phone Number,\n3.full address,\nso, I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the\nofficial documents. It is now left to you to decide if you still need\nthe consignment or allow us to repatriate it back to the UK (place of\norigin) as we were instructed.\nLike I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most\nimportantly because he gave a false declaration,  he could not secure\na valid non-inspection document(s), etc. You can either come in\nperson, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery\nCompany/agent that will provide the necessary security that is\nrequired to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination\nof your choice. I need all the guarantees that I can get from you\nbefore I can get involved in this project, I will show the scan copy\nof your consignment and my phone number in my next letter so that we\n can communicate effectively,\nBest Regards,\nMark williams\nInspection officer\nEmail:makts122@gmail.com\n "

        "body": "Hello Dr. Mark Williams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the abandoned shipment. I find this quite intriguing. Could you please provide me with more details about the contents of the metal trunk boxes? I am curious to know what exactly is inside.\n\nAlso, could you clarify why the consignee declared the shipment as personal effects classified documents instead of money? It seems like an unusual choice.\n\nFurthermore, I would like to understand how my name and email ended up on the official document from the United Nations' office in London. Can you explain that to me?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSamuel"
