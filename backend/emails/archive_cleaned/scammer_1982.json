        "body": "Hello Joseph M. Otting,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the payment I am supposed to receive from the Fund Office. I appreciate the update and your efforts in getting this resolved.\n\nI have a few questions before proceeding with the payment. Could you please provide more details about the affidavit claim? What exactly is it for and why is it necessary? Additionally, could you clarify how long it will take for the payment to be finalized once I secure the affidavit claim?\n\nRegarding the options for receiving the funds, I would prefer to have it deposited directly into my bank account. Could you please let me know what information you require from me in order to proceed with that option?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
