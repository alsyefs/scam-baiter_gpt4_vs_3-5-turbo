        "body": "Hello Mrs. Elizabeth King,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I'm thrilled to hear about this payment from the United Nations, it's quite a surprise! \n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that there were some irregularities observed in my file due to contact with various officials and financial institutions. Could you please elaborate on what these irregularities are? \n\nAlso, I noticed that there are several options for receiving the funds - Swift Transfer, Certified Bank Draft Cheque or ATM Master Card. Could you kindly explain the differences between these methods and why there would be an official charge to process my payment?\n\nLastly, could you provide more information about the Insurance Policy IIP associated with my fund from Monitory Fund Unite IMF? It's all a bit confusing for me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
