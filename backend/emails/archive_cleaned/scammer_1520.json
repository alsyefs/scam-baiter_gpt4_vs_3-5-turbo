        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your concern about potential scams and the effort to compensate those who may have been victims in the past. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you provide more details about the United Nations' involvement in this program? How did they approve UBA Bank in Africa for processing the ATM Visa Card?\n\n2. What is the purpose of the ATM Visa Card? How does it work exactly?\n\n3. Could you please explain why DHL Courier is the only company you have signed a contract with? Are there any other delivery options available?\n\n4. You mentioned that some courier companies ask for additional fees such as security fees, IMF fees, or FBI fees. Can you clarify why these fees are not required in this case?\n\n5. Is there any documentation or proof that can be provided to verify the legitimacy of this program and its association with the World Bank and United Nations?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarcelene"
