        "body": "Hello Alain Coulibaly,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you provided. However, I have a few questions before I proceed with filling out the form.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the funds that I am supposed to claim? How did I become eligible for this?\n\n2. Is there any specific reason why my name and address are required on the form? What purpose does it serve?\n\n3. Could you please explain what you mean by \"rounding up this week\"? What is the deadline or urgency associated with this process?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nShirley"
