I am 80 years old and presently suffering from\nLeukemia. My health condition has gotten worse and just two weeks ago\nmy doctor informed me that my condition has reach a critical stage,\nand that I have just 3 dates left. This confirmation from my doctor\nwas and still is devastating news; it is hard to know that you have\njust a little time left to live here. My late husband was a contractor\nin both South Africa and London, he died in a plane crash and during\nthe period of our marriage we could not bear any child. My late\nhusband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited all his\nbusinesses and wealth both in Australia  and London-United Kingdom.\nAfter the doctorâ€™s medical pronunciation that I have just few months\nto live, I decided to divide my wealth to contribute to your country\nand Africa where my late husband as a contractor made lots of money. I\nwant to assist you with the funds to do great charity works in your\ncountry, this is my last wish. I selected you after searching few\nwebsites; I prayed and was led to you. I am willing to donate the sum\nof Fourty Million, Six Hundred thousand United States Dollars\n(USD$40,600,000.00) to the less privileged through you. Please I want\nto transfer this money to you as I am travelling to all the countries\nof the orld  soonest to have my lawyer amend my WILL. If you can\nhandle this fund and very sure to do charity works on my behalf then I\nwill include your name in my WILL when in South Africa, and from there\nI will travel to Australia to meet a specialist as I want to be buried\nalongside my late husband when I passed on. Note that this fund is in\nthe financial institution and upon my instruction; I will file in an\napplication through my family attorney Senator Joseph for the transfer\nof the money into your account for the said purpose\nLastly, I honestly pray that this money when transferred will be used\nfor the said purpose even though I might be late then. I have come to\nfind out that wealth is vanity and I made a promise to God that my\nwealth will be used to support the poor and the assist the sick. Do\nlet me know if you will be able to handle this fund and use it for the\nsaid purpose so that I will inform my attorney and my bank on my\ndecision.\nReply to me using (\nsenotorsanusi@gmail.com\n)\nGod bless you\nMrs. Anna Cooper"
