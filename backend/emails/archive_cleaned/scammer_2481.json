        "body": "Hello Sophie Karren Ms.,\n\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking. It's great to hear that you're doing well in Australia and have started some investment projects. That sounds really exciting!\n\nI appreciate your kind gesture of writing a cheque in my name. However, I'm a bit confused about the details. Could you please clarify why you chose to deposit the cheque in Senegal? Also, could you provide more information about this bank manager Abdul?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nHeather"
