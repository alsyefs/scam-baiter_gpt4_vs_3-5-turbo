I don't recall instructing anyone named Mr. John Tsai to claim or receive any funds on my behalf. And as far as I know, I haven't signed any Deed of Assignment in his favor.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this fund? How did it come into existence and why is it associated with my name? Also, could you explain what the CLEARANCE fee is for?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nTyrell"
