        "body": "Hello Mr. Oliver Alawuba,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this exciting news! I'm thrilled to hear about the funds that have been credited into an ATM debit card. It's unfortunate to hear about the corruption within the banks, but I'm glad that it's being handled now.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain how my name came up for this award? And why is it being delivered via an ATM debit card instead of a direct bank transfer?\n\nAlso, could you provide more information on how the World Bank Group and United States treasury department are involved in this process? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSalvador"
