        "body": "Hello Dr. Tunde Thompson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite thrilled to hear about this payment, although I must admit, it's a bit unexpected. \n\nI'm not very familiar with Bitcoin Wallet or ATM card payments. Could you please explain more about these methods? How do they work exactly? And how can I ensure that the transaction is secure?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the fiscal year payment and why it's being issued to me? It would be great if you could clarify these points.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCassandra"
