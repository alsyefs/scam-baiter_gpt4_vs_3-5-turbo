Can you tell me more about what your role involves? \n\nAs for the details you asked for, I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable sharing personal information online. However, I'd love to continue our conversation and learn more about your work.\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the ATM card and gift cards? How are they related to your work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nHelen"
