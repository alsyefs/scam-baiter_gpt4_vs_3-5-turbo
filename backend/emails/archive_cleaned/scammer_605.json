        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your email has caught my attention. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more information about the UN WB FNG Commission? I am not familiar with this organization and would like to know more about their role and purpose.\n\nSecondly, regarding the two individuals claiming to be my relatives, William Hughes and John Camel, I find it quite surprising as I am not aware of any such individuals in my family. Can you provide any additional details about them? How did they come to know about my supposed death?\n\nLastly, I would like to understand the process of transferring or delivering the funds. Could you please explain the options available and any associated fees or charges?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in clarifying these matters. Looking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nTheresa"
