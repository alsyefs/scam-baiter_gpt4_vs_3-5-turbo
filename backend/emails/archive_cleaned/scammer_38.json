        "body": "Dear Edward,\r\n\r\nIt is my pleasure to reply to your inquiry line by line and in blue colour\r\nso as not to miss anything.\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my pending contract payment. I\r\nappreciate your willingness to assist me in resolving this matter. Can you\r\nplease provide me with more information about the African Bank ADB and its\r\nrole in facilitating the payment?\r\n\r\nI want you to know that all central banks of member states are affiliated\r\nto African Development Bank (ADB) as banks in different member states align\r\nwith their central banks so our mandate goes a long way to source the root\r\nof your transactions through central banks of member states, the amount\r\ninvolved and why your funds have not reached you till date.\r\n\r\nWe can go a long way to call the money back wherever it is located in the\r\nworld because we have the mandate of the African Union (AU) which is an\r\naffiliate of the United Nations (UN).\r\n\r\nYou have to cooperate with us if not we cannot be able to help you. The\r\nfirst step is to send a questionnaire to you to test and know if you are\r\nreally the owner of the fund and to know your last communication with the\r\npaying bank.\r\n\r\nThe earlier you believe what I am telling you and start cooperating the\r\nbetter and easier for both of us. I am in the introductory part of my\r\nassistance to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I would like to understand how the CEO of ADB will be\r\ninvolved in the process and what percentage he expects in return for his\r\nassistance. Could you please clarify this for me?\r\nHe is directly involved because he was given the mandate by the African\r\nUnion (AU) to investigate numerous reports of mis-appropriations of funds\r\ninvolving contract payment and other businesses that their beneficiary have\r\nnot received their payments due to one problem or the other, especially\r\ncases involving private and central banks of member states. He recruited us\r\nas a team so we are working for the same purpose and we are achieving\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nHe cannot propose this to you directly, I know if you offer him 10% of the\r\ntotal sum he will go for it and help you get your approval and payment, but\r\nthis has to be confidential (hope you understand this?)\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am curious about the UK Debt Management Office's role in\r\ntransferring the funds directly to my account. How does this process work,\r\nand what guarantees do I have that the funds will indeed be transferred\r\nsuccessfully?\r\n\r\nAfter our inquiries and investigations, we shall report to the CEO and will\r\nin turn give approval to it and then forward it to the ADB office in the\r\nUK. This is where you will receive your payment from. It shall be so\r\nbecause we don’t want anything to be a hitch within Africa again.\r\n\r\nLastly, I understand that you mentioned a need for compensation for your\r\nassistance. While I appreciate your efforts, could you please explain\r\nfurther what kind of compensation you are expecting? It would be helpful to\r\nhave a clear understanding of what is required.\r\n\r\nI am handling your case and off course I will expect you to appreciate me\r\nafter you have received your payment. I hope to have explained very well to\r\nyou, if there is anything still not clear to you do ask me and I will be\r\nhonoured to give you a reply.\r\n\r\nHave a good and wonderful day.\r\n\r\nYour faithfully,\r\n\r\nAlain Coulibaly (Office of the CEO. IRTD. ADB)."

        "body": "Dear Alain Coulibaly,\n\nThank you for your prompt response and for providing me with more information about the African Bank ADB and its role in my pending contract payment. I appreciate your efforts to assist me in resolving this matter.\n\nI understand that the African Bank ADB is affiliated with all central banks of member states, and its mandate involves sourcing the root cause of delayed payments through these central banks. It's reassuring to know that you have the mandate of the African Union AU, which is an affiliate of the United Nations UN, to help retrieve funds wherever they may be located.\n\nIn order to proceed, you mentioned that I need to cooperate with you by providing some information. Could you please clarify what specific information you require from me? I want to ensure that I am providing the correct details.\n\nRegarding the involvement of the CEO of ADB, it's interesting to hear that he has been given a mandate by the African Union AU to address cases involving delayed payments. However, I would like further clarification on what percentage he expects in return for his assistance. Understanding this will help me assess the feasibility of moving forward.\n\nYou mentioned that the UK Debt Management Office will play a role in transferring the funds directly into my account. Can you please explain how this process works and what guarantees there are that the funds will indeed be transferred successfully? It's important for me to have a clear understanding of this aspect.\n\nLastly, while I appreciate your efforts in handling my case, could you please provide further details on what kind of appreciation or compensation you are expecting? It would be helpful for me to have a clear understanding so that we can proceed accordingly.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance and prompt replies.
