        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for your message. It's really interesting to hear about this Certified Bank Cheque or Master Card. I'm not quite sure I understand how it works though. Could you please explain a bit more about how the ATM card works in any machine and how the Certified Bank Cheque can be deposited into my bank? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"withdraw dollars daily\"? Is there a limit to how much I can withdraw each day? And when you say \"wait for bank working to clear\", do you mean that there is a waiting period before I can access the funds from the cheque?\n\nI look forward to hearing more about this!\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
