It's unfortunate that there are fraudsters operating in the country, but I'm glad to hear that efforts are being made to help victims like myself.\n\nCould you please provide more details about how exactly my name was included in the files of scam victims? I want to make sure that this is a legitimate process and not another scam.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what fees need to be paid for the signatory of the Texas airport authority? I want to understand all the necessary steps involved before proceeding further.\n\nThank you for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeroy"
