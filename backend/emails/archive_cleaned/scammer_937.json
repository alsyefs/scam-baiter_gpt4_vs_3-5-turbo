        "body": "  Attention: Beneficiary ,\nFollowing the recent meeting held by the executive board of this esteemed financial institution, members of the Audit Committee on Foreign Unclaimed Payments and International monetary fund {IMF}. We are very pleased to contact you due to a report reaching us regarding your UNCLAIMED FUND of One Hundred and Twenty  Five  Million  United States Dollars  (US$125,000,000.00) only which is long overdue for payment but was made impossible by some impostors/corrupt officials.\nIn the course of our General Auditing and Account revision of this last quarter of 2023, we discovered that the Bank Accounts belonging to some Benefactors have been changed on the basis that the owners DIED a couple of months ago or have given out an authorization note of change of data.\nAfter the investigations however, it was revealed that there are Foreigners who are collaborating with Retired Staffs to make these changes illegally without the knowledge of the  Benefactors and one traced to your own change is this (Mrs Emily R. Harris) who said you are dead, hence have forwarded some authorization documents so as to divert your fund. The bank account below was forwarded/presented by Mrs. Emily R. Harris as the new account for receipt of the funds:\nBank: Hang Seng Bank\nBank Address: 83 Des Veoux Road,\nCentral - Hong Kong\nAccount Name: Emily R. Harris\nAccount Number: 235-325172-882\nBank Code: 024\nSwift Code: HASEHKHH\nIn order to confirm her request hence we have to send this urgent and very important letter to your email address which after 48 hours and NO RESPONSE, it will be ascertained that you are truly DEAD as reported by Mrs Emily R. Harris.  Thereafter we can proceed with her telegraphic transfer hence your next of kin.  If proved otherwise by you to be alive?, please forward to us all the related Benefactors particulars including your Telephone numbers, contact address, attached Identification card/passport etc. , these details from you will help reach a conclusion that you are still alive.\nAnything contrary to this claim will help us charge this Lady to court and prosecute her while your fund will be paid to you immediately without  further hitch. We anticipate an earliest response.\nYour faithfully,\nDr. Noel Quinn.\nChief Executive Officer,\nForex / Probate department.\nHSBC London, United Kingdom.   "
