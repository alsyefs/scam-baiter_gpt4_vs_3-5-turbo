        "body": "Hello Jessica Gilbato,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe my email was selected in the draw. This is the first time something like this has happened to me. \n\nI'm curious about how this whole process works. Could you please explain a bit more about how my email was chosen? And what exactly does a Fiduciary Agent Claim Manager do?\n\nAlso, I noticed that you mentioned some big companies like Apple Inc, Amazon, Microsoft, Walmart, and META. Are they all involved in this lottery? How do they contribute to it?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJuan"
