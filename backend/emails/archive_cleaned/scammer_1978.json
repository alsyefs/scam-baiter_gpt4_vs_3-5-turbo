        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I understand that there is an issue with the delivery of my ATM VISA CARD from the United Nations fund unit. Could you please provide me with more details about the custom clearance fee that needs to be paid? I want to make sure I have a clear understanding of the situation before proceeding.\n\nAdditionally, could you explain why the payment can only be made through Western Union or Money Gram? Is there a specific reason for this preference?\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDaniel"
