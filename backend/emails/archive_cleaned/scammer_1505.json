Yes, I am still interested in placing an order with you. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with the payment.\n\nCould you please provide me with the updated American bank details? I want to make sure that everything is correct before making the payment. Also, could you clarify what payment methods are accepted? It would be helpful to know if there are any specific instructions or requirements for making the payment.\n\nThank you for your assistance and prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nPaul"
