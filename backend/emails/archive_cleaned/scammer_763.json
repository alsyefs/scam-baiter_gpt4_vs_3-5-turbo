Can you please confirm the purpose of this ATM card? Is it for a specific bank or organization?\n\n2. What is the exact amount of the security keeping fee that needs to be paid?\n\n3. Could you provide more details about the insurance delivery fee that has already been paid? How much was it and what does it cover?\n\n4. Can you explain the process of payment for the security keeping fee? What methods are accepted?\n\n5. Is there a deadline by which I need to pay the security keeping fee?\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nShirley"
