        "body": "  My Dear Friend,\nI am Ms Nolan Lauren Nicole, a seasoned banker with TD Bank here in\nthe States and I wish to request for your assistance in a deal that\ninvolves $15.2M (Fifteen million, Two Hundred Thousand United States\nDollars) with our Bank. This deal by virtue of its nature must be\nutterly confidential and top secret. Though I know that a transaction\nof this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, I am\nassuring you that this will be done under a legitimate arrangement\nthat will protect both of us from any breach of the law. I came to\nknow you in my private search for a reliable and reputable Business\nPerson/individual that can handle this confidential deal with me,\nwhich requires maximum confidence and trust from both sides.\nMY PROPOSITION;\nI am an account officer to one of the dormant accounts with our bank\nthat belong to one of our deceased customers Mr. Paul Louis Halley, a\nrich French citizen who was into several businesses here in the States\nbefore his death along with his wife in an air crash. Before their\nuntimely death our customer deposited the Sum of $15.2M (Fifteen\nmillion, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank\nhere in the States. View the fact here:\nhttps:/ /dbpedia.org/page/Paul-Louis_Halley\nDuring the bank audit exercise, it was discovered that a lot of\naccounts have been dormant as an unclaimed credit balance, hence our\nmanagement decided during the current re-capitalization in our banking\nsector, to phase out all accounts that have been dormant. As the\naccount officer to the late Mr. Paul Louis Halley, I have made several\ninquiries to his high commission to locate my client's extended\nrelatives, but all my efforts proved abortive, I then decided to trace\nhis relatives and family members over the internet, and yet all effort\nbecame abortive. However, I found you as my instinct convinced me that\nyou will be a trustworthy and honest business partner and I decided to\ncontact you to assist me in repatriating my late client's deposit\nbefore it gets confiscated or declared non-serviceable by our bank, TD\nBank here in the States.\nI therefore wish to request for your assistance and permission to\npresent you as the appointed next of kin to Mr. Paul Louis Halley so\nthat the $15.2M (Fifteen million, Two Hundred Thousand United States\nDollars) can be released and paid into your account as the\nbeneficiary. Be informed that this transaction is risk free otherwise\nI will not contact you because it is against our bank policy. Please\nget in touch with me immediately if you are interested to assist me;\nthe call-up capital is significant. After receiving your thoughts and\nconsideration, further information will be provided to you.\nLooking forward to your prompt response in my private email:\nnolanlnic@gmail.com\nYours Sincerely,\nMs Nolan Lauren Nicole.

        "body": "Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nThanks for your email.\r\n\r\nWe can conclude this transaction within 2 to 3 working days if you\r\ncooperate with me. All arrangements are already in place. The only\r\nthing we need now is for an Attorney who is attached to TD Bank to\r\nvisit the court on your behalf and then apply for the issuance of an\r\nINHERITANCE CERTIFICATE in your name, and this move will help register\r\nyour name permanently as the legitimate and legally recognized next of\r\nkin to late Mr. Paul Louis Halley. And for us to be able to achieve\r\nthis, we will need the services of one of the attorneys who is\r\nattached to TD Bank here in Texas, so that you can email the Attorney\r\nand tell him that you are next of kin to late Mr. Paul Louis Halley's,\r\nand that you need him to help you visit the Court and obtain an\r\nINHERITANCE CERTIFICATE in your name. That's all we need the Attorney\r\nattached to TD Bank to do for us. And the INHERITANCE CERTIFICATE can\r\nonly be accepted by TD Bank if they notice that the INHERITANCE\r\nCERTIFICATE is obtained by an Attorney who is attached to their Bank.\r\nThat's the reason why we need the services of an Attorney attached to\r\nTD Bank Texas.\r\n\r\nSo if you email the Attorney attached to TD Bank and he reply and\r\nagree to work for us, you and i will send him a court fee which he\r\nmust pay to the Court before he can obtain an INHERITANCE CERTIFICATE\r\nin your name. I will prepare and send him half of the court fee, while\r\nyou prepare and send him the other half of the court fee. He will then\r\nvisit the Court and obtain the INHERITANCE CERTIFICATE in your name\r\nwithin 1 day, and forward a copy of it to you. After this, i will then\r\nprovide you TD Bank customer care Department email address where you\r\nsend the following: 1. INHERITANCE CERTIFICATE (which will be in your\r\nname), 2. DEPOSIT CERTIFICATE OF THE US$15,200,000, 3. DEATH\r\nCERTIFICATE OF LATE MR. PAUL LOUIS HALLEY & 4. YOUR BANK ACCOUNT\r\nDETAIL FOR THE INHERITANCE FUND TRANSFER. I have the DEPOSIT\r\nCERTIFICATE that was issued to late Mr. Paul Louis Halley the day he\r\ndeposited US$15,200,000 with my Bank. And i will send you this\r\ndocument in my next email.\r\n\r\n1,2,3 & 4 mentioned above are all that my bank needs to officially\r\nrecognize you as a legally accepted next of kin to late Mr. Paul Louis\r\nHalley. And once TD Bank receive 1,2,3 & 4 stated above, the Bank will\r\ncredit your receiving bank account within 24 hours. If you want the\r\nfund transferred to your existing bank account, thats fine, but if you\r\nwant to open an online account with my bank where my bank will\r\ntransfer the inheritance i can also guide you to do so, so that you\r\ncan be doing online transfers by yourself using the online account.\r\nThis transaction will take us less than 3 days to conclude, and we\r\nwill have the inheritance fund readily credited to any bank account of\r\nyour choice....and with no single risks involved. And we will process\r\neverything legally and professionally, that no trace of wrong-doing or\r\nconnivance will ever be identified. And no member of the deceased\r\nfamily will ever have the legal standing to appear anytime in future\r\nto make trouble, because we will register your name in court and make\r\nyou the legally and constitutionally accepted next of kin to late Mr.\r\nPaul Louis Halley. And this arrangement will legally destroy every\r\npresent and futuristic risks.\r\n\r\nAfter the transfer, 50% of the total inheritance will be yours, while\r\n50% will be mine.\r\n\r\nFrom my thorough investigation, the court will charge the Attorney for\r\nthe Court to be able to issue the INHERITANCE CERTIFICATE in your\r\nname. This process will take only 1 working day and the INHERITANCE\r\nCERTIFICATE will be issued in your name. And this court fee is the\r\nonly fee we will pay till we complete this transaction and have the\r\ninheritance fund remitted to your bank account. We are not paying any\r\nmore fees after the token court fee is paid by you and me. And please\r\nyou should bear in mind that you and i will be sending this court fee\r\nto the Attorney who is attached to TD Bank once he reply to your 1st\r\nemail accepting to help us visit the court and obtain the INHERITANCE\r\nCERTIFICATE in your name; You and i will share the Court fee equally,\r\nand be rest assured that the court fee will not be much.\r\n\r\nIf you are in agreement with this arrangement and ready to cooperate\r\nwith me, please get back to me so that i can provide you details of\r\nthe Attorney to enable you contact him immediately.\r\n\r\nI am attaching copy of my Driver's License for your records. It is\r\nalso very important that you attach your own means of identification,\r\nso you are hereby advised to attach a copy of any of your means of\r\nidentification when replying this email. In order for us to establish\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nHere is my phone number which is also on WhatsApp: +1 (650) 762-9452\r\n\r\nI look forward to hear from you asap.\r\n\nYours Sincerely,\r\nMs Nolan Lauren Nicole."
