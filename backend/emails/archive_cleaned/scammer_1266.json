        "body": "Hello Bob Adi,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite surprising to hear about this fund from President Ahmed Bola Tinubu. I must admit, I wasn't expecting such news.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did the president come to know about my case? And why has he decided to compensate me with such a large sum?\n\nI'm also curious about the process of releasing these funds. Could you explain it a bit more?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSergio"
