I want to make sure I understand the purpose of these funds.\n\nAdditionally, could you explain why there is a fee involved in obtaining the Clean Bill Record? Is there any way to waive or reduce this fee?\n\nI also noticed that you mentioned paying the fee through Apple Card, Steam Gift Card, or eBay Gift Card. Why are these specific methods required? Are there any other payment options available?\n\nThank you for your assistance in answering my questions.\n\nBest wishes,\nWinnie"
