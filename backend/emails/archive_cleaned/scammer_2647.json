        "body": "  Dear Sir,\nI am writing to inform you that the president has given the final directive to the governor of the CBN, and in line with the president's directive, the DEBT APPROPRIATION MANAGEMENT was established for the process.\nI noticed that your payment was included in the recently released government official gazette regarding the payment of the debt.\nI believe you have seen or read the gazette of the payment in the newspapers published a week ago. They even published the names of the beneficiaries who are to benefit from the payment from the established agency, and your name was among those mentioned. It is for this reason that I am contacting you so that you can expedite the action to have your debt fund paid to you.\nMy name is Mr. Wilson Ogunleye, and I work at the Central Bank of Nigeria. I was drafted to the Debt Appropriation Management as the Apex bank representative, and I have been the one against the release of your fund so through in the past.\nPlease do not consider me as someone who is wicked, as I have nothing against you. My frustration is directed towards your so -called partner who deviated from our initial agreement when he requested that I assist in placing your payment in the computer system for processing payments to beneficiaries, which I did. However, after seeing that it was done, he absconded and did not keep to the agreement, which is why I stopped your payment.\nI will not go into detail about what transpired between your so -called partner and me, as it would take up much of our time. I would prefer to deal with you directly rather than this person you call your partner.\nBefore we can proceed, I would like you to promise me the following and hope that you will not deviate from this, as your partner did in the past:\n1. Keep your so -called partner out of this, as I do not want him to know my involvement until the fund is received by you.\n2. Be willing to offer me 20% of the fund if you receive it in your account.\n3. When the fund is received in your account, assist me in coming over to meet you by providing me with a letter of invitation.\n4. Help me open an account in one of the preferred banks in your location where I can lodge my share and possibly assist me in deciding on a business in which to invest. I would prefer not to receive my share here due to potential inquiries by the authorities regarding the source.\n5. Other matters will be discussed when we meet face to face in your country.\nI await your prompt response, and once I receive it, I will inform you of how to get your payment without any upfront payment.\nPlease send your reply to this email: \nogunleyewilson6@gmail.com\n Respectfully Yours,\nMr. Wilson Ogunleye   "

I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that my name was mentioned in a government official gazette regarding a debt payment. I don't recall having any outstanding debts, but perhaps there's been some confusion.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your past experiences with my so-called partner. It sounds like a difficult situation indeed. However, I must admit that I'm not aware of any partner or agreement you're referring to.\n\nAs for your requests, they seem quite significant and I would need more time to consider them. Could you please provide more details about this debt fund? How much is it exactly? And why has it been held up until now?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by offering you a percentage of the fund? Is this a common practice in these situations?\n\nLastly, regarding opening an account in one of the preferred banks at my location and assisting you with business investments - could you explain why this is necessary? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"

        "body": "Dear Sir,\r\n\r\nThank you for your prompt response to my email.\r\n\r\nI have been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to communicate with you\r\ndirectly, rather than through the individual I previously believed to be\r\nyour partner, a claim which you have now denied. Regardless of whether or\r\nnot this individual was your partner, I am confident that we can have a\r\nsuccessful and fruitful transaction. I believe that fate has brought us\r\nthis opportunity, and I trust that you will handle our affiliation with\r\nsincerity and trust, ensuring that the funds are released to your account.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your acceptance of the conditions I outlined in my previous\r\nemail, particularly with regard to keeping this matter confidential from\r\nyour partner, as any involvement on his part could lead to serious\r\nconsequences under the civil code of conduct.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned in my previous email, I am a member of the Debt\r\nAppropriation Management and am responsible for the file documentation of\r\npending payments of debts. The contractor who executed the project in the\r\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC has passed away, and I have\r\nreason to believe that you are the next of kin to whom the payment of his\r\ndebt is owed. The agency responsible for handling these debts is the Debt\r\nAppropriation Management (DAM).\r\n\r\nThe DAM was established to address the mishandling of funds by government\r\nofficials, which had made the process of debt payment difficult for\r\nbeneficiaries.\r\n\r\nUnder the guidelines of the DAM, the agency takes on the legal\r\nresponsibilities of the ministries processing the debts owed to each\r\nbeneficiary, recommending and releasing funds without demanding fees\r\npayable to the ministry.\r\n\r\nThis was done to ensure accountability and to prevent the exploitation of\r\nrecipients through the imposition of various fees and charges. The DAM has\r\nalready begun\r\ncommunicating with beneficiaries whose files have been handed over for the\r\nongoing debt reparation by the president. Your file is among those being\r\nprocessed, and you will be contacted by the DAM in due course. When you\r\nreceive their message, please inform me so that I can provide guidance on\r\nhow to proceed. I am a\r\nrepresentative of the Central Bank of Nigeria and am part of the DAM.\r\n\r\nI hope you understand why I cannot be directly involved in fronting your\r\npayment to the DAM, as it would raise questions among other members of the\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we will wait for the DAM to communicate with you regarding the\r\npayment. If you do not receive any correspondence from the DAM, I will\r\ninvestigate the matter.\r\n\r\nPlease keep an eye on your inbox for any messages from the Debt\r\nAppropriation Management, and inform me when you receive one.\r\nThe sum which is to be processed paying to you as the next of kin is\r\nUS$10,500,000.00.\r\n\r\nPlease fill the form I attached on this mail with your required information\r\nwhere Dam will process the payment to you.\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you.\nSincerely,\r\nMr. Wilson Ogunleye"

She passed away about two years ago and had been living abroad\r\nfor most of her life before returning to Nigeria to handle the late\r\ncontractor's affairs. It seems that she may have designated you as the next\r\nof kin before her death.\r\n\r\nThe late contractor did not leave a will, and Mrs. Obinaju, in the absence\r\nof any specified next of kin, put your name forward to receive the funds\r\nowed for the project. This is why your email contact was included in the\r\ncontract document released to DAM, as it was believed that you might be\r\nrelated to the late contractor and entitled to receive the funds.\r\n\r\nI propose that we work together to ensure that you receive the funds as the\r\nrightful next of kin. I will use my position to facilitate the legal\r\ntransfer of the funds to you, and we can both benefit from this\r\narrangement. I will guide you on how to handle any communication from the\r\nmanagement to ensure a smooth process.\r\n\r\nThe amount due to the late contractor is US$10,500,000.00, which is the sum\r\nto be paid for the executed project with the Nigerian National Petroleum\r\nCorporation.\r\n\r\nIf you agree to proceed, please keep this matter confidential and do not\r\ndiscuss it with any third party to avoid our government interference which\r\nmay land me into trouble.\r\n\r\nDAM will contact you to initiate the claim process.\r\nPlease fill out the attached reactivation form and send it to me promptly\r\nso that I can include it in your file.\r\n\r\nIt was reliable stated the contractor died as a result of a heart-related\r\ncondition on March 12th 2007. His heart condition leading to his death was\r\ndue to the death of all members of his family in tsunami disaster in\r\nSumatra, Indonesia.http:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Ocean_earthquake.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your response so that we can move forward with the claim.\nBest regards,"

Health is indeed wealth.\n\nYour explanation about the process involving DPVB, DAM, and the Ministry of Finance was quite enlightening. It's interesting to learn how these government offices work together in approving and releasing funds.\n\nI'm curious though, what does DPVB stand for? And what about DAM? Also, could you please elaborate on the role of the Central Bank in this process?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"

I've been very busy with work at the office.\r\n\r\nThose offices you have mentioned are all connected, no payment of  the debt\r\nowed to a beneficiary can be released without going through the approval of\r\nthose offices. This is a standard practice in most countries to ensure\r\nchecks and balances.\r\n\r\nThe approval and documentation from Dam after approval in Dam are taken to\r\nDPVB, where they conduct checks to verify the payment. Once they are\r\nsatisfied with the proof provided, they will sign off on the approval,\r\nwhich then goes to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Finance will\r\nthen release the Exchange allocation to the Central Bank of Nigeria, which\r\nwill carry out the release of the funds to the beneficiary's account.\r\n\r\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria, being the Apex bank, will release the funds to\r\nthe beneficiary's account as prescribed by DPVB."

        "body": "Dear\r\n\r\nI feel like I've explained this to you multiple times, and I'm frustrated\r\nthat you keep asking the same question. In any organization, whether\r\nprivate or government, there are different departments that handle specific\r\nfunctions.\r\nFor example, in established companies, the accounting department has its\r\nown responsibilities, and the person who approves payments is not\r\nnecessarily the same person who works in the accounting department.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the relationship between DAM and DPVB. The DAM reviews\r\nclaims from beneficiaries and approves payments, and then the DPVB gives\r\nthe final approval. These two offices work together in the process of\r\nreviewing and authorizing debt payments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe DAM's approval is crucial because they scrutinize the beneficiaries and\r\ntheir claim documents. They have a direct link to the ministries that\r\nawarded the projects and sometimes visit the ministry to assess the nature\r\nof the project and the associated documents. They serve as the link between\r\nother offices and the president who created the office to handle debts.\r\n\r\nOnce the Central Bank receives the Allocation, it should not take more than\r\n48 hours for the funds to be released.\r\n\r\nThank you for your understanding.\nSincerely,\r\nWilson"
