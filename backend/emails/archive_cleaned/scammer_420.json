        "body": "Hello Mrs. Christine Lagarde,\n\nWow, this is such an unexpected surprise! I can't believe that the European Central Bank would reach out to me personally. It's really amazing how the economic recovery program is helping people like me who were affected during former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump's regimes.\n\nI'm curious though, how did you find out about my situation? And could you please explain a bit more about this ATM card? How does it work exactly?\n\nAlso, I'm a little confused about the information you need from me. Could you clarify why you need my profession and age? \n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
