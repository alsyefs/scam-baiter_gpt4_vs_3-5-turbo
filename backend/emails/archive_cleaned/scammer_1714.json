        "body": "Dear Mr. Tom West,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the delivery of an ATM card. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring the safe delivery of my package. However, before I proceed, I have a few questions.\n\n1. Can you please provide more information about the sender of this parcel? How did they obtain my address and why are they sending me an ATM card?\n\n2. Is there any specific reason why the sender chose your courier company for this delivery? Are you affiliated with the ATM Card payment office in Nigeria?\n\n3. Could you explain the process of registering my package and how I will receive the tracking numbers? Will it be through email or any other means?\n\nI apologize for these inquiries, but I want to ensure that everything is legitimate and secure before proceeding with any further steps.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristian"
