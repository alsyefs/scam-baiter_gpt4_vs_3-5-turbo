        "body": "Hello Mr. Alastair Borthwick,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the payment of my due funds. I appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more information about the OWNERSHIP CLEARANCE APPROVED document? What exactly does it entail and why is it necessary for the release of my funds? \n\nAdditionally, could you clarify who exactly seized the necessary documents that guarantee the legality of the funds? You mentioned that they were seized by the finance minister, but I would like to understand why and how this happened.\n\nLastly, could you explain how the fee for obtaining the OWNERSHIP CLEARANCE transfer paper should be paid? Is there a specific method or platform that I need to use?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJorge"
