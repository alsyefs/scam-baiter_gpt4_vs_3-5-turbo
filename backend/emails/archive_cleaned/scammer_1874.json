Can you tell me more about how my details were forwarded to you by the Monetary Fund and Federal Bureau FBI? \n\nAlso, could you please explain a bit more about the different options for receiving the funds? The ATM Card option sounds interesting but I'm not sure I fully understand how it works. Would I be able to use this card just like a regular debit card?\n\nI appreciate your help with this matter.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDoyle"
