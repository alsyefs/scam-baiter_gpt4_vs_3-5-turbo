        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for sharing this information with me. It's quite an interesting story, and I'm glad to hear that you've had such a positive outcome. \n\nI have a few questions if you don't mind. How did you initially get involved in the situation in Nigeria? And how did you come across Barrister Edmond Walls? He seems like a very helpful person.\n\nAlso, could you please tell me more about the process of obtaining the document from the court of law in Nigeria? I'm curious about how these things work.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJan"
