I have been in search of a trustworthy person for the purpose of helping me reach out to the poor people among us. Twice I have been betrayed by the persons I thought I could trust. They both made away with the money meant for the poor people but yet,  with an absolute belief that good people still exist in this ungodly world, I was willing to keep on searching and by the grace of God, I found your email so I decided to contact you hoping that I can trust you with my finances.\nMy name is Reverend Sister Myleen Pedro and I am serving at Our Lady of Remedies Catholic Church in Manila Philippines. I am 67 years and suffering from Pancreatic Exocrine Cancer. I have managed my health for over 2 years but recent consultations show that my situation has become worse. According to my doctors, I have just 8weeks to live if I insist on the subsequent surgical operation scheduled for next month at Johns Hopkins Health Centre Baltimore Maryland in the USA. This really got me scared and I have been very unhappy since then. It's even more saddening knowing that I have no child of my own due to my spiritual commitment which did not permit me to marry.\nAt this point I am totally helpless because these things are beyond my powers. Due to this reason, I have made up my mind to donate all my life savings and family inheritance, which seems to be about the sum of $2,150,000.00 (Two Million One Hundred and Fifty Thousand US Dollars) to you rather than allow my wicked uncle to inherit them since he is my only surviving relative.\nI give you the permission to utilize 45% (Forty Five Percent) of this fund for your private wishes which will be useful to you and your family, then utilize the other 55% (Fifty Five Percent) for charity work by means of organizing a foundation in your country under my name, as I would want my name immortalized as my existence on earth comes to an end.\nThis cash is deposited in a dependable bank in the Philippines and currently I have informed my legal professional approximately my selection to will this fund to you. You are to get back to me immediately if you are fascinated to perform this task, so that I can direct you on how to get in contact with my lawyer and account officer.\nLastly,  I know I have never met you or set my eyes on you before, but through prayers and fasting done by my spiritual adviser, Rev Fr Vijay Drego, I was able to choose your address among all I came across with.  Provide the information below through my private email address (\nrevlucymahata@gmail.com\n) in other to fulfill this which bothers me most:\nYOUR  NAME:………………?\nYOUR  COUNTRY:…………?\nYOUR  PHONE NO:………?\nOCCUPATION:……………?\nAGE:……………………………?\nSEX:………………………?\nSincerely,\nReverend Sis. Lucy Mahata"

        "body": "Hello Reverend Sister Lucy Mahata,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope this message finds you well too. I appreciate your concern for the poor and your desire to make a positive impact in the world.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your health condition and the challenges you're facing. It must be difficult for you, and I can understand why you would want to ensure that your life savings are used for a good cause.\n\nHowever, before we proceed further, I have a few questions. Could you please provide more details about the foundation you mentioned? What kind of charity work would it focus on? Also, could you tell me more about your lawyer and account officer? How can I verify their credentials?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTiffany"
