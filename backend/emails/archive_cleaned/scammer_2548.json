I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain more about how the MONETARY FUND IMF and the United Nations are involved in this? \n\nAlso, I'm curious about the ATM card. How does it work exactly? And why is it necessary to renew it every 4 years?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nEllen"
