        "body": "Hello Mr. Ryan T. Young,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing this information. It's quite a surprise to hear about this situation, I must say.\n\nI'm curious, could you please explain more about how the Fidelity Asia Bank Limited got involved in my case? And what is the role of the UN in all of this?\n\nAlso, I would like to understand better why there is a need for me to pay a certain amount first before receiving the approved funds? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nNorma"
