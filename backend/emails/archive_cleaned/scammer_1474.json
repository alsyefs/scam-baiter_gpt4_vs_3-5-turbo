        "body": "Dear Mary Beth,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the World Debt Recovery Committee. I appreciate your concern and willingness to assist with my fund. However, I have a few questions before we proceed.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more information about the specific fund that you are referring to? I want to make sure that we are on the same page and that I fully understand the situation.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned Mrs. Glenda F. Ward claiming that she has authorization from me to change my bank account details. I must clarify that I have never authorized anyone, including Mrs. Ward, to make any changes or claim funds on my behalf. Could you please explain how this misunderstanding occurred?\n\nLastly, what steps do you suggest I take in order to resolve this issue and ensure the prompt transfer of my funds? I want to make sure that everything is done correctly and securely.\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nTamara"
