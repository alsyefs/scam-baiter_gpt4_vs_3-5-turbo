        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the opportunity to receive my funds through your online banking system. However, before proceeding, I have a few questions.\n\n1. Can you please provide more information about your bank? What is the name of the bank and where is it located?\n\n2. How secure is your online banking system? What measures do you have in place to protect customers' personal and financial information?\n\n3. Are there any fees or charges associated with creating an online account and transferring funds?\n\n4. Could you explain the process of creating an online account with your bank? Is it a simple and straightforward process?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you with the requested information.\n\nBest wishes,\nStephen"
