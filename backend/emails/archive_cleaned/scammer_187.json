Could you please provide more details about this? Where is the transfer coming from and why does it require clearance?\n\nI don't have a Fund Record of the transfer at the moment. Could you kindly guide me on how to obtain one? \n\nLooking forward to your guidance.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJeff"
