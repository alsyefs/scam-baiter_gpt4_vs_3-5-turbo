However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the payment that is in your custody? What is the nature of this payment?\n\n2. Why is there a fee required to receive my funds? Can you explain the reason behind it?\n\n3. How secure is the online transfer or ATM card option? Are there any risks involved?\n\n4. Is there a specific deadline by which I need to make the payment in order to receive my funds?\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
