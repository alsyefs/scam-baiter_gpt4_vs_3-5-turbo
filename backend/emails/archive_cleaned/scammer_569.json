It's really exciting!\n\nI must admit, though, some parts of your message are a bit confusing to me. Could you please clarify what this fund payment file is about? And why was it brought to your office specifically?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a fee that needs to be paid. Could you explain more about what this fee is for? And why does it need to be paid with an iTunes Card or Steam Wallet card?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions. I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristine"
