How was I chosen as a winner? \n\nAlso, could you please explain the options for receiving the prize? What does \"Diplomatic delivery to your door step\" mean? And what would happen if I chose to come down to Burkina Faso?\n\nI'm really excited and looking forward to hearing more about this.\n\nThank you so much!\n\nBest wishes,\nClarence"
