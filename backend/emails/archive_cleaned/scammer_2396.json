        "body": "Dear Chief S. Buckner,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the Supreme Court of Florida. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring the security of my funds. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with any transactions.\n\n1. Can you please provide more details about the specific amount of money that is under your care? It would be helpful to know the exact sum involved.\n\n2. Who is Mrs. Doris Woolwine and how is she related to me? I don't recall assigning anyone to receive funds on my behalf, so I would like some clarification on this matter.\n\n3. Could you explain why purchasing a US Google Pay or US gift card is necessary for redeeming my ATM Master Card? What purpose does it serve?\n\nI look forward to your response and further guidance on how to proceed with this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nNicolas"
