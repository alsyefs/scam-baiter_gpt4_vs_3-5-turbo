        "body": "  Hello / Urgent Information.\nI am Peter Collins. a Computer Scientist with the central bank of Nigeria, a 28 years old, I just started working with the C.B.N, I eventually came across your funds file and found out it was marked X and your release disk painted RED, I took time to study it and found out that you have paid VIRTUALLY all fees and certificate but the fund was not released to you.\nThe most annoying thing is that they don't want to tell you the truth that on no account will they ever release your funds to you,instead they let you spend money unnecessarily. I do not intend to work here all the days of my life, I can release this funds to you on one condition, that is if you can guarantee me of my security, and how I can run away from Nigeria if I do this for you, because if I don't run away from this country after i've made the transfer to you, I will be seriously in trouble and my life will be in danger. Your payment can come through, draft, cashier`s cheque, Cash, International Remittance, ATM, Online Banking etc.\nYou might definitely not understand this because you are not a Nigerian.,It`s like a Mafia setting in Nigeria. The only thing I will need to release your funds to you is a special HARD DISK we call it HD120 GIG. I will buy two of it, recopy your information, destroy the previous one, punch in transfer secret codes to the transfer computer for the funds to reflect in your bank account within 24 banking hours. I will clean up the tracer and destroy your file, after which I will run away from Nigeria to meet with you. If you are interested.\nAS SOON AS I RECEIVE YOUR EMAIL I WILL LET YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE DISK WILL COST YOU.\nDo get in touch with me immediately, You should send to me your convenient tel/fax numbers and contact address, WhatsApp number. This is necessary for easy communications and also to re-confirm your banking details, so that there won't be any mistake in transferring your funds.\nFor a phone conversation, please call me on +234-.\nRegards,\nPeter Collins   "

        "body": "Hello Peter Collins,\n\nWow, your message is quite intriguing! I must say, it's not every day that I receive an email from a computer scientist at the central bank of Nigeria. It sounds like you're in quite a predicament.\n\nI'm curious about this special HARD DISK you mentioned, the GIG. How does it work exactly? And how can it help in transferring funds?\n\nAlso, you mentioned various methods through which the payment can come through - draft, cashier cheque, Cash, ATM, Online Banking etc. Could you please elaborate on these methods? Which one would be the most secure and efficient?\n\nI'm sorry but I won't be able to provide my phone number or address at this time. However, we can continue our conversation here via email.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nMarilyn"
