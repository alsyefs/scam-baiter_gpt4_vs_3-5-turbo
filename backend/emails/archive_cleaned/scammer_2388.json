        "body": "Hello Rt. Hon. Richard Wagner, Chief Justice of Canada,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me! I'm thrilled to hear about this good news regarding my fund payment. It's quite a surprise, I must say!\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about the ATM Master Card and how it works? Also, could you provide more details about the Steam Wallet Cards? I'm not very familiar with them.\n\nAnd just to clarify, once I send the fee, there will be no other charges in the future, correct?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nNorman"
