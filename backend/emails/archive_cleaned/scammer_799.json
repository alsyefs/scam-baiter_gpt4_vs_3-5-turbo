        "body": "Hello James William,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's great to hear that my ATM card package is ready and waiting for me. I appreciate the assurance that everything will be fine and that my rights as a customer are protected.\n\nI understand that the agent needs money for taxi fare to deliver the ATM card to my home address. However, I'm a bit confused about why a gift card is needed for this. Could you please explain more about how this works?\n\nAlso, could you provide more information about UPS COMPANY? How do they fit into this process?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
