I'm glad to hear that you have succeeded in getting the funds transferred with the help of your new partner from Japan. It sounds like an exciting investment project.\n\nI would be interested in receiving more information about the ATM card and how it can be delivered to me. Could you please provide some details on how this process works? How long does it usually take for the card to be delivered? Is there any cost involved in receiving the card?\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about the investment project you mentioned. What kind of project is it? Are there any risks involved? How do you plan to ensure a successful outcome?\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnnette"
