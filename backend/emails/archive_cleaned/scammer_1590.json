If I fail to hear from you\nafter 72 hours, it will be assumed the petition of Mrs. Morgan is true\nand the fund will be paid to her without further delay.\nTherefore, \nif you are still alive, reconfirm your particulars as\nstated below and send immediately ,\n1.

        "body": "Hello Glen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I had no idea that my name was on such a list. \n\nI'm sorry to hear about the confusion regarding my supposed demise. I assure you, I am very much alive and well. It's quite alarming to hear about this Mrs. Morgan claiming otherwise.\n\nCould you please tell me more about how my email address ended up on this list? And what exactly does it mean that these funds are yet to be paid? Also, could you provide more information about this Debt Recovery Committee (DRC) and its operations?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
