However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the contents of the parcel? It would be helpful to know what exactly is inside the ATM CARD.\n\nAlso, I'm curious about why there is a need for me to send money through a gift card or other means. Can you explain why this is necessary?\n\nLastly, could you clarify how long it will take for the parcel to reach me once I provide my delivery address?\n\nI look forward to your response and further instructions.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarilyn"
