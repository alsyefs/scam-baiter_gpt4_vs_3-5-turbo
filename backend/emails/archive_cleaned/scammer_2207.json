In order words we are now requesting that those involved should pay only the sum of $55.00 to receive all their payment abandoned in our custody.\nBesides, this is an opportunity for you to comply and your funds shall be transferred to your designated address. But remember after (3DAYS) you don’t make the payment, then we will divert your funds to the Government Fund to avoid problems or we shall cancel the payment for this year until next year because this year is not like the previous year. Again after (3DAYS) we shall commence a new project before the year runs out. That is the reason why we decided to help all our customers before the new project begins.\nWe advise you to make sure you pay the payment of $55.00 immediately so that your total amount of $9.5million USD can be registered for you to start receiving $6,000 as of tomorrow.\nBe advised that there is no time again for us to call any person on phone unless you call us, E-mail ( \nriamtransferoffi@outlook.com\n ) After the payment of $55 you will start receiving your money every day $6,000 through Ria transfer office, Send the money through RIA transfer or world remit.\nThe moment I receive the payment of $55.00, I will release the first payment information of $6,000 to you, to enable you access and pick up the money and also another payment will be sent to you, hope to hear from you ASAP.\nREGARDS\nMR EDWARD FOWLER.\nFOREIGN OPERATION MANAGER"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Edward Fowler,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing this information. It's quite interesting to hear about the special bonus that RIA money transfer is offering. I'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify what the payment I need to make is for? And how does it help in receiving my abandoned payment?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that after making the payment, my funds will be diverted to the Government Fund. Could you explain more about this process? How does it work exactly?\n\nI'm also curious about the new project you mentioned that will commence before the year runs out. Can you share more details about it?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDoris"
