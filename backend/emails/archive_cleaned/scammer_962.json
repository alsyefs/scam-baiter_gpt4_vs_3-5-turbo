        "body": "Hello Ide Stephen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an interesting piece of information. The African Union's initiative sounds like a commendable effort to resolve issues related to contract payments and other forms of payment.\n\nI'm curious about the process though. How does the committee identify individuals who are eligible for these payments? And how did my name come up in this context?\n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about the Diplomatic Courier Company that will be handling the delivery of funds? It would be great if you could share their credentials or any relevant information that can help me understand their role better.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nStanley"
