        "body": "Hello Mr. David Robert Malpass,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I'm not sure how my name ended up on the list of scam victims, but it's good to know that there are organizations like yours working to rectify such situations.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that the United Nations and IMF instructed your bank to pay USD to scam victims. Could you please provide more details about this initiative? How was it decided who would be compensated?\n\nAlso, you mentioned several methods of transferring the funds - through Bitcoin, bank wire transfer or an ATM visa card. Could you explain a bit more about these options? Which one would be the quickest and most secure?\n\nLastly, regarding the Bank Online security keeping fee that needs to be paid via iTunes or Steam wallet card - could you clarify why this specific method of payment is required?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLinda"
