        "body": "Hello Mike,\n\nThank you for your detailed response. I appreciate the information you've provided. It's interesting to hear about the process involved in this matter.\n\nI'm curious, could you explain a bit more about how the central bank controls other activities of banks in terms of monetary foreign payments? Also, what exactly is the role of the CBN attorney general in all this?\n\nAs for the processing fee, could you clarify why it's necessary and what it covers? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMayra"
