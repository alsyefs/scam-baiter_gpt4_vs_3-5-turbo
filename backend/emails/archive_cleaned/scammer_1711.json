        "body": "Hello Dr. Olayemi Cardoso,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I must say, your email has certainly piqued my interest! It's not every day that one receives an email about a fund from the Governor of the Central.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about this fund? How did it come to be in my name? And why is it being held at your office?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the secured certified mode of payment Via ATM Visa? I'm not very familiar with these financial terms and would appreciate some clarification.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMerrill"
