I am indeed alive and well, and I have not been in contact with anyone named Mrs. Lucia Sausa or provided any new address.\n\nCould you please provide more information about this ATM card? I'm curious to know how it is related to me and why it was sent to the address mentioned in your message.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrancis"
