        "body": "Hello Diplomat Joe Collins,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't expecting any delivery, especially not one of such value. It's fascinating how these things work out, isn't it? \n\nI'm curious about the process though. How did the United Nation come to decide on delivering this fund to me? And why in trunk boxes? That seems like an unusual method.\n\nAlso, you mentioned that you have other deliveries to take care of in various states. Are they similar to mine or different?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nOralia"
