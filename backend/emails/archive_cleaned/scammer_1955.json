It's quite a surprise to learn that my name and email address have been selected for this program.

The initiative to curb poverty is indeed commendable.\n\nI understand that you need some details from me to proceed further. However, I am not comfortable sharing personal information over email due to security reasons. Is there any other way we can verify my identity?\n\nAlso, could you please provide more information about the online banking portal? How secure is it? And how soon can I expect the transfer once everything is in order?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLouis"
