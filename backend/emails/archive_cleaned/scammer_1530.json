However, I must clarify that I am not related to him in any way, despite sharing the same family name.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did you come across my name? And what exactly is required from me in order to assist with the funds?\n\nI appreciate your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nEdward"
