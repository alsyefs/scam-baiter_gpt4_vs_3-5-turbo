        "body": "Hello Mr. Soyer L. Meyer,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. It's quite interesting to hear about the decisions made by the World Oil and Gas Executive board, United Nations, World Bank Monetary Fund IMF, and other organizations.\n\nI'm curious to know more about this process. Could you please explain how my name was selected among the few to receive this sum? Also, could you provide more details on what exactly a 'retrieved and full sum' means?\n\nYou mentioned that my payment would be reserved for FIVE working days. What happens after these five days if I don't respond? \n\nLastly, you mentioned several methods of payment like ATM card or bank transfer. Could you elaborate on these options? How does each method work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
