        "body": "Hello Williams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the delivery of my ATM Visa Card. I appreciate the update and I'm excited to receive it. However, I have a few questions before proceeding with the payment and delivery process.\n\n1. Can you please provide more information about Nicon Insurance? How can I be sure that my ATM Card will be fully insured?\n\n2. Could you explain why I need to purchase an Apple Gift card or Steam wallet Gift Card? How does this relate to the insurance coverage and delivery charges?\n\n3. Is there any way to pay the delivery fee using a different method, such as a bank transfer or credit card payment?\n\nI look forward to your response and further instructions.\n\nBest wishes,\nJeannine"
