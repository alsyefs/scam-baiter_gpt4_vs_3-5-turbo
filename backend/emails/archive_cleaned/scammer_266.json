        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information. It's quite surprising to hear that my name was found amongst those who have sent money through various platforms. I must admit, I'm a bit confused as I don't recall participating in any lottery or expecting funds from the United Nations.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How was my name associated with these transactions? And how did the FBI get involved in this matter?\n\nI'm also curious about the compensation scheme you mentioned. How does it work exactly? And why is it only open to people who wired money via Western Union and Money Gram?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMinnie"
