        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your persistence in trying to help me with my payment. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\n1. Can you please provide more information about the bank processing fee? How exactly does it work and why is an iTunes card or steam wallet card required for this?\n\n2. Is there any way to verify the authenticity of this payment program? Are there any official documents or references that I can look into?\n\n3. Could you clarify the timeline for receiving the funds once the processing fee is paid? How long does it usually take?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDorothy"
