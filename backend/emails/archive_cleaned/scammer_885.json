        "body": "Hello Mr. Ivan Young,\n\nI'm quite surprised to hear about this situation! I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, no car accidents for me, thank goodness. It's quite shocking to hear that someone would claim such a thing.\n\nAs for the sum of US Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars, it's certainly news to me. Could you please provide more details about how this came to be? How did the World Bank come to mandate you to contact me specifically?\n\nAlso, could you clarify who MR. GERSHON SHAPIRO is? I don't recall ever meeting or interacting with anyone by that name.\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nRuth"
