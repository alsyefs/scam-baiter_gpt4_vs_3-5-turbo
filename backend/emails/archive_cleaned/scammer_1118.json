        "body": "Dear esteemed and respected Mr.xxx ,\nThank you very much for your prompt reply to my letter to you and your\nentire family. You should be informed that the deceased (Engr.xxx Manou\n) left no beneficiary/next of kin to his codicil with me before he died,\ntherefore, you and I to be able to claim his inheritance estates from\nthe bank where he deposited the US$31,000,000.00(Thirty-one million USD)\nwe need to apply for a legal letter of administration in your name as\nthe personal representative to administrate the deceased’s estates so\nthat you can claim the inheritance money from the bank where he made the\ndeposits.\nHowever, for you mentioning differences in the  surname of my late\nclient which you are seeing as your first name does not signify anything\nto inculcate any spirit of fear into you because the Death Certificate\nas an evidence of poof before any authority was recorded and issued by\nthe Ghana National Population Commission here in Ghana which carries\nyour one of your names as the family name that you already have as your\nidentification and not with standing you have one of the names as your\nidentification there is  no any difference in it as much as you have one\nof the names as a proof of  identification\n with that alone I'm very \nliable to represent you adequately and protect your interests to the end\nuntil you have finally receive the funds in your country.\nThis legal document (Grant of Representation/legal letter of\nadministration) will instate you as the legal/legitimate beneficiary to\nthe deceased’s estates; we shall apply for this letter of administration\nin your name at the Probate Registry division of the High Court of Ghana\nso that a legal LETTER OF ADMINISTRATION/GRANT OF REPRESENTATION can be\nissued in your name as the legal named beneficiary and administrator to\nthe deceased’s estates. I know exactly how we are going to apply for\nthis document since this is my field as a lawyer knowing all the legal\nprocedures to follow to achieve our goal, and you don’t have anything to\nfear since you are a family member and sharing the same name with the\ndeceased we are sure to succeed at the High Court of Ghana here on your\nbehalf.\nI therefore want you to \nimmediately forward me your international\npassport copy or national identification or driver’s license in a scan\nattachment by email \nto enable me take all the necessary legal remedial\nactions on your data as the next of kin\n with the codicil of the\ndeceased. In this kind of application, personal representatives are\ncalled EXECUTORS if appointed by WILL and ADMINISTRATORS if there is no\nWILL. Administrators are appointed by the Probate division of the High\nCourt in any country where the inheritance matter is being handled as\nalready informed above.\nHowever, the New Eco-was law of succession/claims/fund indicates a\nduration in which such claims could be tolerated. The financial\ninstitution has mandated me to present the next of kin or a relative who\nwill claim the funds and Failure to respond to this ultimatum would\nlegally allow the financial institute to report this fund to the central\nbank of Ghana as unclaimed funds (Lack of supersede).\nFor your information, I contacted you in the first place only because of\nyour family name which is in the Death Certificate of my late client and\nwith that the funds will be released and transferred to you without any\ncontroversy.\nPlease, there is nothing to worry about or fear,as the family legal\nAttorney everything will go smoothly to our own favor so fear not only\nrespects my legal guidance and direction, we both need this confidence\nto make this happen.\nMeanwhile, if there is anything related to this heritage that is not\nvery clear to your understanding, and you want to ask a question, please\nfeel free to ask, if any, and I'll be very glad to answer you correctly.\nThe publication will be made here in Accra-Ghana where the deceased\nresided before his demise.\nIn conclusion, it's my concern to demand your ultimate honesty,\nco-operation and confidentiality to enable us to conclude this\ntransaction. I GUARANTEE that this process would be executed under a\nlegitimate arrangement that would legally protect you from any breech of\nLaw.\nRemain blessed,\nKelivin James Arthur Esq\nAttorney/Lawyer."

        "body": "Dear Kelivin James Arthur Esq,\n\nThank you for your detailed response. I appreciate your efforts in helping me claim the estates of the deceased Manou. I understand that I need to apply for a legal letter of in my name as the personal representative of the deceased's estates in order to claim the funds from the bank.\n\nI also appreciate your explanation regarding the surname confusion. It is reassuring to know that there is no difference and that I can still be represented adequately as a family member sharing the same name with the deceased.\n\nRegarding the required documents, I understand that you need a copy of my passport, national ID, or driver's license. However, for security reasons, I am hesitant to share such personal information over email. Is there any other way we can proceed with this process without sharing these documents?\n\nFurthermore, could you please provide more information about the New law of succession claims fund? How long do we have before this claim becomes invalid? I want to ensure that we meet all necessary deadlines.\n\nThank you once again for your assistance and guidance. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeticia"
