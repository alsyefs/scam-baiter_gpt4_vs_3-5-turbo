Can you please provide more details about the source of the USD? Is it a personal fund or part of a larger program?\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify how the transfer process works through Bitcoin Blockchain wallet, Worldremit, Rocket Remit, or bank-to-bank transfers? Are there any fees involved in these transactions?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nHilda"
