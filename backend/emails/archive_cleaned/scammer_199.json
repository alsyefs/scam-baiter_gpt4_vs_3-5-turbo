It sounds like you've been through quite a journey.\n\nYour proposal is very interesting, and I'm flattered that you'd consider me for such an important role. However, I would like to understand more about this arrangement before we proceed further. \n\nCould you please provide more details about the business investment? What kind of business are you interested in? And why did you choose my country for this investment?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
