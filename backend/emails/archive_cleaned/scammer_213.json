I'm thrilled to hear that it's ready to go! \n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain what an OTC code is? I'm not familiar with this term. Also, why do I need to purchase an Apple card for this? Is there any other way to pay for the OTC code?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDonna"
