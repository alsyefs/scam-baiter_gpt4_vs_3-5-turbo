        "body": "Hello Mr. Honey Louis,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have provided regarding my funds. It's interesting to hear that they have been in the Federal Government Custody for two years.\n\nI would like to know more about the process and ensure that everything is legitimate. Could you please provide me with some additional details? Specifically, I would like to understand how the online banking option works and what steps are involved in setting up the account. Additionally, if I choose the ATM card delivery option, could you explain how the delivery process works and which delivery company would be used?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
