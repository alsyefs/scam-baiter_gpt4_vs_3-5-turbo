I appreciate your suggestion of using Cash App, Zelle, or PayPal for the transaction. However, before we proceed, could you please provide me with more information about why my assistance is needed and how this transaction would work? I want to make sure I fully understand the situation.\n\nThank you again for reaching out and God bless you too.\n\nBest wishes,\nWalter"
