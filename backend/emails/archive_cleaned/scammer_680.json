However, I must admit that I am a bit confused about the situation.\n\nI did not send anyone named Mr. Johnson Campbell Sr. to claim the funds on my behalf. This is the first time I am hearing about him. Could you please provide more information about this individual? How did he come to possess a letter claiming to be from me?\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify the process of transferring the funds to my bank account via KTT? What are the necessary steps I need to take in order for this transfer to be completed successfully?\n\nThank you once again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nKatelyn"
