Firstly, we would like to\r\ninform you based on the details we received from the International Monetary\r\nFund (IMF) regarding your funds. We were informed by the International\r\nMonetary Fund (IMF) officials that your funds were supposed to have been\r\nreceived by you long ago but due to the corrupt practices of the Bank\r\nofficials in those Banks, that was the reason you have not yet received\r\nyour funds.\r\n\r\nWe personally carried out some investigations on those Banks in Africa and\r\nEurope and we discovered that most funds beneficiaries are being asked to\r\npay certain irrelevant charges by those Banks officials especially Africa\r\ncountries and Europe, therefore making it very difficult for those\r\nbeneficiaries to claim their funds which is contrary to Section \"37\"\r\nSubsection \"C\" of the Article XII of Banks and other financial decree of\r\n1995 as amended in 1998.\r\n\r\nPlease note that you are to receive your funds ($9,500,000.00) through our\r\nonline banking system which we believe is the safest way of making\r\ntransfers in the modern banking system.\r\n\r\nTo enable us commence with the opening of your online banking account, you\r\nare requested to provide us the below required information.\r\n\r\nYour\r\nName:............................................................................................................................................\r\nOccupation:............................................................................................................................................\r\nAddress..................................................................................................................................................\r\nDate of\r\nbirth:..........................................................................................................................................\r\nMarital\r\nstatus:........................................................................................................................................\r\nSex:......................................................................................................................................................\r\nNext of\r\nkin:............................................................................................................................................\r\nID\r\nCard..................................................................................................................................................\r\nTelephone::............................................................................................................................................\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of the above required information, we shall commence\r\nfurther with the opening of your online banking account and your funds will\r\nbe credited into your online banking account.\r\n\r\nSincerely Yours,\r\nMr. James Smith\r\n(Funds-Transfer Director)"
