        "body": "Hello Mr. Mark Davis,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring the safe delivery of my fund. However, before we proceed, I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the meeting that was held? Who else was present at the meeting and what decisions were made regarding the delivery of my fund?\n\nSecondly, I would like to know more about the National Security Company. Can you tell me about their reputation and track record in handling such transactions? It's important for me to have confidence in the organization responsible for delivering my funds.\n\nLastly, could you explain why it is necessary for a consultant banker to meet with me in person before the delivery takes place? What specific purpose does this serve and how will it ensure that there are no mistakes made during the process?\n\nI look forward to your prompt response and further clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nAshley"
