It's unfortunate that there are people out there who engage in such activities.\n\nI would like to know more about how the United Nations plans to compensate those who have been scammed. Could you please provide me with additional details on the process? How exactly will the compensation be released? Is there a specific reason why I was selected as a scam victim?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the ATM card mentioned in your email. How does it work? Can you explain more about its features and how I can access the funds?\n\nLastly, could you clarify what you mean by \"paying for the delivery fee\"? Why is there a need for me to pay for this fee, and how can I ensure that it is safe to do so?\n\nThank you again for reaching out to me. I look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRuth"
