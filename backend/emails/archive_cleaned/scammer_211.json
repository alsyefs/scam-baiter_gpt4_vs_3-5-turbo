        "body": "Hello Mrs. Edna Melvin,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your concern about scammers and hackers, it's definitely important to be cautious when dealing with financial matters online.\n\nRegarding the payment, I think it would be best if we proceed with a bank-to-bank transfer. It seems like a secure and reliable option. However, before I provide you with my bank details, could you please clarify what this payment is for? I want to make sure I have all the necessary information before proceeding.\n\nAlso, if we go ahead with the bank transfer, how long do you think it will take for the funds to be credited to my account? And are there any fees or charges associated with this transaction that I should be aware of?\n\nThank you once again for your prompt response and assistance. Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nHelen"
