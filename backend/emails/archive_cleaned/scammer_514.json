        "body": "Hello Mr. Daniel,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about the contract payment fund. It's really exciting to hear that the United Nations and World Bank have approved it! I must say, it's been quite a journey trying to receive this fund.\n\nI understand that my presence is required in Paris, France to sign all the necessary documents. That sounds like an interesting trip! However, before we proceed further, could you please provide more details about these documents? What kind of information will they contain?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the process of receiving the draft or check and depositing it into an account. Could you explain how this works in more detail? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRyan"
