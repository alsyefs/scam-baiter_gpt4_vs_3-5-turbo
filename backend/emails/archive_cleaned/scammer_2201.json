I'm not sure how I ended up with such an amount in my name.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this? How did this fund come into existence? And why is it necessary for me to pay charges for the transfer permit code?\n\nI'm also curious about the United Nation's Approval order. What exactly does that entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nTina"
