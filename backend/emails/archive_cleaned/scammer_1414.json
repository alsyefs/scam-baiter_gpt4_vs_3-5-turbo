        "body": "Hello Mr. Kenneth Yakubu,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this exciting news! I must say, it's not every day that one receives an email about a substantial sum of money. \n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in relation to this ATM Master Card? And could you please explain more about the United Nations' involvement in this? It's all very intriguing.\n\nAlso, I'm wondering if there are any other ways to cover the delivery fee? Is it possible for it to be deducted from the card itself?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBetty"
