        "body": "Hello Mr. Wray,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the abandoned funds. I must admit, this is quite surprising news. Can you please provide me with more details about the funds and how they ended up in your custody? I want to make sure that everything is legitimate before proceeding any further.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what exactly the anti-terrorist clearance fee is for? I want to understand why it is necessary and how it ensures that the funds are not related to any fraudulent or illegal activities.\n\nI appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRosa"
