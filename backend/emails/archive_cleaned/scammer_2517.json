That's a lot of money! \n\nI'm curious though, how did this happen? How was my name chosen for this incredible opportunity? And what exactly is the approval order RAOC with the Provision of Affidavit of Claim?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the steam wallet card or Razor Gold Gift card? I'm not very familiar with these things.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nJanet"
