However, I have a few questions before we proceed.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the inherited sum that is currently in the Bank of Ghana suspense account? How did this sum come about, and who is it inherited from? Also, what is the total amount of the fund?\n\nAdditionally, you mentioned pressure, threats, and blackmail directed at you due to your refusal to authorize the remittance. Could you elaborate on this situation? Who is pressuring you, and why are they doing so?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
