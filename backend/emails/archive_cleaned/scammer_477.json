        "body": "Good morning, Susan Flint! Thank you for reaching out to me. I hope you're doing well. I received your email regarding the delivery of my ATM card from HSBC BANK UK. I appreciate the bank's efforts to prove the legitimacy of the fund and cover the delivery insurance charge.\n\nI understand that the United Nations Delivery Agent requires an inspection at my local airport before proceeding to my home address. Could you please provide more information about this inspection? What exactly does it involve, and why is it necessary?\n\nAlso, you mentioned that I need to send payment through BTC Bitcoin or purchase iTunes or Razor Gold gift cards. Can you explain why these specific methods are required? Is there a particular reason for not accepting other forms of payment?\n\nLastly, could you please confirm the delivery details that you have on file? I want to make sure that the correct address is provided for a smooth delivery process.\n\nThank you again for your assistance, Susan. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJose"
