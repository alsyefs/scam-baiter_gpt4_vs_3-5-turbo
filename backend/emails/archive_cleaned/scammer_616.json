        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I don't recall instructing anyone named Mr. John Perry to receive any payment on my behalf. Could you please provide more details about this situation? \n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the award payment that you mentioned? It sounds very interesting and I would love to know how it came about.\n\nI'm also curious about the different modes of payment you mentioned - bank transfer, ATM card, and cash payment center in London. How does each method work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKarin"
