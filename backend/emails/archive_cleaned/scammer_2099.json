        "body": "Hello Prof. Francis Bill,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about this matter. It's quite interesting to hear about the resolution reached by these World Governing Bodies and the steps being taken to address overdue payments.\n\nI'm curious, how was my name discovered as next on the list? I don't recall having any pending contracts or winnings that would warrant such a payment. Could you provide more details about this?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about these Approval Numbers and Release Code Numbers? How are they generated and what is their significance in this process?\n\nLastly, I'm not comfortable sharing personal information like my full name, contact details, profession, age or bank name over email. Is there another way we can proceed without needing to share these details?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nHenry"
