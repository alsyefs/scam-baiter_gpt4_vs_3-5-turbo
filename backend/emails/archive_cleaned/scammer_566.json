On the 11th of November,2008. My client,his wife And their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu/Lagos Express Road.\nUnfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident, Since then I have made several inquiries to several Embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.\nAfter these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my client,I can easily convince the bank with my legal practice that you are the only surviving relation of my client. Otherwise the Estate he left behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this\nhuge deposits were lodged.Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about $15 million U.S dollars(Fifteen million U.S.America dollars).\nConsequently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over several years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased,so that the proceeds of this account valued at $15million U.S dollars can be paid to your account and then you and me can share the money. 55% to me and 40% to\nyou,while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may require.\nAll I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through and also forward the following to me:\nYour Full Name:\nYour House Address:\nYour Tele-phone And Fax No:\nYour Age and Gender :\nYour Nationality:\nYour Occupation:\nI guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.\nYours Faithfully,\nBarr.
