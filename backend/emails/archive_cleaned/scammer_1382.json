        "body": "  From Mrs. Tantiana Borisma.\nI know that this letter may come to you as a surprise, I came across\nyour email contact from my personal search and I decided to reveal\nthis lifetime secret to you as I prayed hard before I sent you this\nemail. I believe that you will be honest and sincere to fulfill my\nfinal wish before I die. I am Tantiana Borisma, from (Kuwait), but I\nwork in (Lhasa) Ivory Coast. I am 54 years old now, and a business\nwoman dealing with gold exportation, for the past eight years, but\nhave been suffering from breast cancer for a long time From all\nindications my condition is really deteriorating, and my doctors have\ncourageously advised that I may not live beyond the next one year,\nbecause the cancer has reached a critical stage. I have only one\ndaughter who's 16 years old. My husband died in a fatal motor accident\nsome years back, and I decided not to re- marry because of my bad\nhealth. Before the death of my husband, he deposited the sum of\n$55,500,000 million dollar in the bank,\nI want you to assist me in order to claim the fund from the bank, as\nmy husband's foreign business partner. After you have received the\nFund to your account in your country, you will then adopt my only\ndaughter to your country for continuation of her education. Keep 20%\nof the money for yourself for your help to my only daughter and invest\nthe rest of the money in my daughter's name. I believe that you will\nbe in a better position to help me claim the Fund from the Bank. As\nsoon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the Bank\nwhere the Fund is deposited, AS MY FAMILY'S NEXT OF KIN. Please assure\nme that you will act accordingly as I stated here. If you are\ninterested, kindly reply immediately so I will Swear an Affidavit in\nyour name as my family's only appointed Beneficiary/Next of Kin, to\nthis fund through my family's lawyer, Barr. O. Agbakoba, Email:\n(\njusticechambers@mail.ee\n) You can contact the chambers for\nclarifications.\nHope to hear from you soonest.\nMrs. Tantiana Borisma   "

        "body": "Hello Mrs. Tantiana Borisma,\n\nI'm really sorry to hear about your health condition and the challenges you're facing. It's a lot for anyone to handle. I can't imagine how tough it must be for you and your daughter.\n\nYour story is quite touching, and I appreciate your trust in sharing such personal information with me. However, I have a few questions that I hope you won't mind answering.\n\nFirstly, could you please tell me more about your business? How did you get into the gold business? \n\nSecondly, could you provide more details about the bank where the fund is deposited? What's the name of the bank and where is it located?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about your daughter? What are her interests and what does she want to study?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLouise"
