        "body": "Hello Mr. Kevin Michael,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't expecting any funds, especially not in such a large amount.\n\nI'm curious about how my name and email ended up on this list. Could you provide more information about the process that led to my selection? Also, who is Donald from Bent Tree Circle? I don't recall knowing anyone by that name or address.\n\nRegarding the bank account details you mentioned, they are unfamiliar to me. I don't have any connection with Chase Bank or the account number provided.\n\nBefore we proceed further, could you please clarify these points for me? It would help me understand the situation better.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nFrank"
