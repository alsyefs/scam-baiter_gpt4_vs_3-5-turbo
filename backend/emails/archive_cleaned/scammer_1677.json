I appreciate the notification and would like to know more about reclaiming my abandoned funds. Can you please provide me with some additional details?\n\nCould you clarify what exactly needs to be done in order for me to receive my funds? You mentioned making a payment, but I would like to understand the purpose of this payment and how it relates to releasing my funds.\n\nAdditionally, could you explain why there is a time constraint? It would be helpful for me to know the deadline by which I need to take action.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nCliff"
