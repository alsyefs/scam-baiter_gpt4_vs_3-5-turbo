        "body": "Hi Mr. Muhammad inu,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me again. I hope you're doing well too. I vaguely remember our previous conversation about your investment proposal. It's interesting to hear that the transfer was completed with the help of another partner. Can you tell me more about this partner, Ahmed Hamed Al Subhi? How did he come to be involved in the process?\n\nI appreciate your gratitude and willingness to compensate me for my efforts. The amount you mentioned, US One Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars, is quite substantial. However, I'm a bit confused about why the funds were uploaded onto an ATM Card instead of being transferred directly into my account. Could you please explain the reason behind this decision?\n\nYou mentioned that I need to contact Arturo Russell regarding the delivery of the ATM Visa Card package. Could you provide me with his contact information? Also, what documents will be included in the package and why are they necessary for accessing the funds?\n\nLastly, could you clarify if there are any fees or charges associated with receiving and activating the ATM Visa Card? I want to make sure I have all the information before proceeding.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nJoseph"
