I appreciate your dedication to upholding the laws and ensuring public safety and security.\n\nI understand that there have been some issues with my pending payment, which has not been released due to official negligence.

Could you please clarify how much the Payment Release Order fee is? Additionally, can you explain why this fee is necessary for the transfer of funds?\n\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to verify the authenticity of this communication. Can you provide any official documentation or references that confirm your position within the World Bank Group?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRose"
