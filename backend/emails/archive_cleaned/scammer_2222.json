        "body": "Hello Kellie Webb,\n\nThank you for reaching out and considering me for this opportunity. I'm intrigued by the prospect of working with Samsung, South Korea's biggest company. However, I have a few questions that I'd like to clarify before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please elaborate on the role and responsibilities? You mentioned receiving payments from customers via bank draft and deducting a percentage as my pay. Could you provide more details about this process?\n\nSecondly, what kind of support will be provided by Samsung in terms of training or guidance to carry out these tasks effectively?\n\nLastly, how would we handle any potential issues or disputes that might arise with customers during the payment process?\n\nI look forward to hearing back from you with more information about this business proposal.\n\nBest wishes,\nLela"
