        "body": "Hello Mr. Richard Mills Jr.,\n\nIt's a pleasure to make your acquaintance! I must say, it's not every day that I receive an email from the United States Ambassador to Nigeria. It sounds like you've had quite a busy start to your tenure.\n\nI'm intrigued by this situation you've described. Could you tell me more about these fraudsters who mentioned my name? And how did they come across my details in the first place?\n\nAlso, could you provide more information about this payment of five million United States dollars? That's quite a substantial sum! How was it determined that I should be the recipient of such an amount?\n\nI look forward to hearing more about this fascinating situation.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarina"
