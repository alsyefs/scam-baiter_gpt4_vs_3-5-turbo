        "body": "Hello Mr. Peter Iwu,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must admit, your message has caught my attention. I have had some experiences with online scams in the past, so I'm a bit cautious when it comes to sharing personal information or making any payments.\n\nHowever, I am interested in learning more about this ATM card and how it is related to the Federal government of Nigeria. Could you please provide me with some additional details? How exactly did this meeting with Bola Ahmed Tinubu and top officials lead to the release of my fund? And why is there a delivery fee that needs to be paid?\n\nI would appreciate it if you could clarify these points for me. Thank you.\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
