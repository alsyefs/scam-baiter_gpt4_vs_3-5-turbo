I haven't received any emails or notifications regarding payments from Europe, Africa, or any other countries. Nor am I aware of being a legitimate contractor fund in any of the mentioned regions.\n\nCould you please provide more information about this? How did my details come up in your system? And what does it mean to be a legitimate contractor fund?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nChris"
