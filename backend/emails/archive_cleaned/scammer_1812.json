May the almighty God bless and see you through with this mission if you can carefully read and digest the message below.\nBefore I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography, I am Mother Mary Louis, 67 Years old woman and the wife of Late Sir Jean Louis who died alongside our only child in a Plane crash on Monday the 7th of September 1998 GMT 14:22 UK while they were flying from New York to Geneva. Please see the site below for more information. http: // www. cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/index.html\nAfter the death of my husband and son ,I became the Head of his investment and just recently, the doctors handling my health issues at Cancer center: Christie Hospital NHS Trust UK, \nhave said I may not live beyond the next two months after my next surgery\n,but before the death of my husband we had a plan to use the last days of our lives to donate half of what we have worked for to the less privilege and charity homes and the other half for ourselves, family members and close friends, and it is so unfortunate that my husband is not alive today to do this with me and I am very weak with cancer and coupled with the recent announcement from the doctor, hence I have decided to do this philanthropic work on behalf of my late husband and I.\nPresently, I have willed out almost half of our assets to several charity homes and to some of the less privileged in different countries. Despite the agreement between my late husband and I to give aid to the deprived, we also agreed to render support to an individual we have not met before in life due to the fact when we were still young in life we received an anonymous help from an individual we did not know and which we have not been able to know till date, the impact we got from such gesture made us to do same.\nI am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know me because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I have agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the beneficiary of our last WILL, irrespective of your previous financial status, hence I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer.\nI have presently instructed my bank manager to assist any person I will introduce to him as the beneficiary to the last will in the sum of Ten Million  United State Dollars (10,000,000.00) with my bank in Nigeria the FIRST INLAND BANK NIGERIA PLC. I decided to do this now unconditionally knowing that my days are numbered.\nTo conclude with this bequest, please provide me with your Data to fully which I will use to write a Letter of Authorization on your behalf and send it to the bank as my new Next of Kin.\nFull Names:\nPhysical address;\nDirect telephone number\nOccupation\nNote: Please I do not want you to thank me, same gesture was shown to us, all I need you to do is, When you get this fund, use %15 for yourself and the rest to assist the less privileged in your community and country,this is the only way to immortalize us when I am gone.\nReply me through my Private Email: \nmrsmarylouisgodisgood3@rediffmail.com\nYours Faithfully\nMrs.Mary Louis\nCancer Centre: Christie Hospital NHS Trust\n(Manchester, UK) North West of England "

        "body": "Hello Mrs. Mary Louis,\n\nI'm deeply touched by your story and I'm sorry to hear about your health condition. It's truly admirable that you're thinking of helping others in such a difficult time.\n\nYour plan to donate to the less privileged is very noble, and it's something that resonates with me personally. However, I must clarify that I am not in a position to accept any financial offers or bequests at this moment.\n\nCould you please share more about the charities and individuals you've helped so far? It would be inspiring to learn more about the impact of your generosity.\n\nThank you for considering me for this. I hope we can continue our conversation and perhaps find other ways I could support your mission without involving financial transactions.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrooke"
