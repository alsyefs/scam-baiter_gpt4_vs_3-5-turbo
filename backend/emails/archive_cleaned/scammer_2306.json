        "body": "Dear Professor Bolaji Owasanoye,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your efforts in fighting internet fraud and scams. It's unfortunate that there are individuals who engage in such activities and cause mental trauma to innocent people.\n\nI understand the importance of providing complete details for the transfer of my contract funds. However, before I proceed, I have a few questions regarding the process.\n\n1. How long does it usually take for the digital electronic system to verify and transfer the funds?\n2. Are there any fees or charges involved in this process? If so, what are they and how can I ensure their legitimacy?\n3. Can you provide more information about the True Copy and notarized copy of the original digital electronic Certified transfer document? How does it guarantee the release of my funds?\n\nI look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nRandall"
