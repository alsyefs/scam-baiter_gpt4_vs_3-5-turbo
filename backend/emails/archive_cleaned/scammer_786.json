I'm surprised to hear about the arrest of Mr. Jeffery Brooks and the check that is said to belong to me. \n\nI'm afraid I won't be able to come down to the station in person due to my current circumstances. Could you please provide more information on how an attorney can sign on my behalf? Also, could you tell me more about this Economic Impact Payment check? I wasn't expecting any such payment.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nTerry"
