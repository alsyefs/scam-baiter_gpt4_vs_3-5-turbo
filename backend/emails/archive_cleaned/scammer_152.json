They are looking for ways to divert it to an account in Asia (Jordan) where it cannot be traced.\nAs I am writing you now, arrangement is on top gear between some corrupt bank officials to have one Mr. smith Hsu whom they invited for this purpose from Jordan to claim as your representative having a power of attorney to endorse all the necessary release papers and they will wire your funds to his account.\nThe main problem and the only reason why they have been delaying your funds and now want to divert it is that proper change of ownership was not done completely on your overdue fund transfer. your name appears as the beneficiary, whilein ministry of internal affairs-archives unit, Preston  Ltd appears as beneficiary.\nThis matter needs a 100% attention or else your funds within the next seven banking days will be diverted to an unknown account.\nN:B I have to write you with my private email ID  so no one knows I am the person that leaked the truth to you.If you care to get your money get back to me and I will direct you on what to do.\nbest regards.\nRohana Arafath    "
