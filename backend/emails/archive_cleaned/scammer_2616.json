        "body": "Hello Don Robinson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I never thought my name would be among the victims. It's good to know that there are institutions like Wells Fargo Bank looking out for people like me.\n\nI'm curious about the two options you mentioned - Bank to Bank Wire Transfer and Atm Card. Could you please explain more about these? How do they work? And which one would be more convenient for someone like me?\n\nAlso, I'd appreciate it if you could provide more details about this process. How did the Government instruct you to remit the funds? And how was my name chosen?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJudie"
