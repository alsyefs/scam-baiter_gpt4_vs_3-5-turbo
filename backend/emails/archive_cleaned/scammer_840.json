        "body": "Hello Dr. Johnson Coker,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me about this matter. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear that someone is claiming I've passed away! Rest assured, I am very much alive and well.\n\nI don't recall having any business partner named Lee Graham. Could you please provide more information about him? How did he claim to know me? And how did he come into possession of my supposed bank account details?\n\nAlso, could you clarify the origin of this large sum of money? I'm not aware of any dealings that would result in such an amount being associated with my name.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKelly"
