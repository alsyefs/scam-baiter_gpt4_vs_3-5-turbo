It must be really challenging to deal with such situations. \n\nI'm curious about how you managed to find my email address among those scammers. Could you tell me more about how they had my information? Also, I'm surprised to hear about this fund you mentioned. How did it come to be associated with my name?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nNathan"
