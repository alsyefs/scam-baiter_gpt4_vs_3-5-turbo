Could you please provide more details about this? How did my name come up in the records of the Central Bank of Nigeria and other banks?\n\nI'm also curious about the process involved in releasing these funds. What kind of directives are we talking about here? And what does it mean to get the deduction done?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
