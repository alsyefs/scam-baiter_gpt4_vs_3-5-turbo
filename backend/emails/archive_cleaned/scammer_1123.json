I'm really looking forward to having it in my account by Monday.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about the need for my passport photo to set up online account access. Could you please explain why this is necessary? Is there any other way to verify my identity without sharing such sensitive information?\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
