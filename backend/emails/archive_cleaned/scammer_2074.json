I have a Breast Cancer for a very long time. My situation is seriously worsening, and my private doctor estimates that I may only have six months to live because the disease has progressed to the worst and most severe stage.\nI have made the decision to donate my wealth to aid in the growth of Humanitarian Organizations in your country. When you come back to me, I will provide you all the information you need to get this money released to you.\nPlease reply as soon as possible.\nSincere regards,\nMrs. Miriam Paul."
