        "body": "Hello Mrs Anna Walker,\n\nThank you for reaching out and informing me about this situation. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that my name was involved in such an incident. \n\nI would like to understand more about this issue. Could you please explain how my name ended up on the list of those scammed? Also, could you provide more details about the Bank draft that has been issued in my name?\n\nYou mentioned something about a transfer charge fee and buying a card or steam wallet from an apple office or Walmart office. Could you clarify what this is for and how it relates to the situation at hand?\n\nI'm sorry but I won't be able to provide a copy of my ID as per your request due to privacy reasons.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJuan"
