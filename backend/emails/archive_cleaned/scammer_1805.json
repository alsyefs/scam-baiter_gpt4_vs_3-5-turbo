        "body": "Hello Mrs. Linda Jerry,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me about this matter. I must say, it's quite an interesting situation. I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain more about this payment that was left in your custody? How did it end up there?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the special bonus is that you're offering? It sounds intriguing but I'd like to understand it better.\n\nI'm not very familiar with Apple Google Play CARD or Steam Wallet. Could you tell me more about how they work and why they are preferred for this transaction?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLisa"
