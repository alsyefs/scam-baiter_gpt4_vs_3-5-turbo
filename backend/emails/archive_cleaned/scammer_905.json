        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected piece of news. I wasn't aware that I had any property at the George Bush Airport.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this trunk box? How did it end up at the airport and why was it abandoned there? Also, could you clarify what exactly is inside the box?\n\nI'm also curious about how my name got associated with this box. Is there any documentation or proof that links me to it?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJason"
