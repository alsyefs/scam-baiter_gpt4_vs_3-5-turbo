        "body": "Hello Mr. Oliver Alawuba,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the information you have shared regarding the scam victim list and the instructions from the federal government. It's quite concerning to hear about such scams happening.\n\nI would like to know more about how this process works with the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card. Could you please explain in more detail how I would receive the card and how it can be used? Additionally, what are the steps involved in activating and accessing funds from the ATM card?\n\nRegarding the details you mentioned, may I ask why my phone number, valid ID, sex, and age are required? How will this information be used in relation to receiving the ATM card?\n\nThank you once again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrances"
