I appreciate your efforts in ensuring the release of funds that are not associated with illegal activities.\n\nI understand that you mentioned the payment outlets have approved my payment, and I would like to know more about the process. Could you please provide me with some additional details on how this will work? Specifically, I would like to know which cash payment centers in Southern Africa, Asia, or Europe are available for me to visit.\n\nYou mentioned that there are expenses involved in this process, and I'm glad to hear that a seasoned investor sponsor will cover these costs. However, could you please clarify what percentage of my total payment the investor is requesting as their fee?\n\nI look forward to your prompt response so we can proceed accordingly.\n\nBest wishes,\nJack"
