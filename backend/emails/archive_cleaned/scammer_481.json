        "body": "Hello Mr. Kevin K.,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the package. It's quite surprising to hear that there's an ATM card worth a significant amount of money waiting for me. I must say, I'm intrigued by this unexpected news.\n\nI understand from your message that Mr. George Leonard has already paid the delivery fee, which is very generous of him. However, I'm a bit confused about the insurance coverage fee you mentioned. Could you please explain why this fee is necessary and how it protects my package?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the ATM debit master card? How does it work exactly? Can I use it at any ATM machine in my local area?\n\nLastly, could you clarify what you mean by \"Forward The Gift Card And Also The Senders To This Office Once The Payment Is Made\"? What kind of gift card are we talking about here?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMargarita"
