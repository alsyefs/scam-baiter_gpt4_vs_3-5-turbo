        "body": "Dear Elizabeth Phillips,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing your experience. I'm sorry to hear that you fell victim to a scam in Africa. It must have been a difficult situation for you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain what happened and how you were able to recover some of your money through the United Nations.\n\nIt's good to know that there are organizations like the United Nations and helpful individuals like Daniel Martins who assist scam victims in getting their money back. Can you tell me more about how the process worked? Did you have to provide any documentation or proof of the scam? How long did it take for you to receive your payment?\n\nI understand that you came across my email contact from the files Daniel Martins showed you. That's interesting! Could you please clarify what exactly he meant by \"those that are yet to receive their payment\"? Are there other people like me who are still waiting for their money?\n\nThank you again for sharing your story, Elizabeth. It's important for people to be aware of these scams and learn from others' experiences. I hope things continue to improve for you, and may God bless you too.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
