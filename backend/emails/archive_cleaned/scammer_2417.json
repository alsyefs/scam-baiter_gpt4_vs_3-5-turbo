        "body": "Dear George,\r\n\r\nI want to first express my gratitude for your prompt response. Once again,\r\nmy name is Vladimir Baotic, relative to the president of Russia, Vladimir\r\nPutin.\r\nI am an oil merchant trading within Europe and Africa markets in the area\r\nof supplying refined products from Russia. Due to the ongoing Ukrainian\r\ninvasion by Russia,\r\nThe international community has sanctioned Russia and blocked all\r\ninternational swift transfer to other Countries. As a result of the swift\r\nsanction, it has become impossible to transfer money out of Russia to any\r\nother Country. I therefore withdrew a large sum of money (US$30Million)\r\nfrom our various bank accounts, and moved the money out of Russia for\r\nsafety purposes. Currently the money has been safely deposited in a private\r\nFinancial/security company in the United Arab Emirates.\r\n\r\nPutin has placed an embargo on all Russian veterans from traveling out of\r\nthe Country, as a veteran, I am not able to travel out to claim the money,\r\nhence I am\r\nsoliciting your cooperation to stand as my business partner to receive the\r\nmoney from the Financial/security company on my behalf. There is a\r\nFinancial Consultant who is well known to my family and I have contacted\r\nhim on this matter, so he will direct you on what to do to receive the\r\nmoney on my behalf.\r\n\r\nPlease Send your information which I will forward to the consultant so that\r\nwhen you contact him, he will know you are the right person that will work\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nMost importantly I need you to please furnish me with areas of lucrative\r\ninvestment in your country and especially an area where you have vast\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nNOTE: For your participation in this transaction, you will be compensated\r\nwith 20% of the total fund while you will invest the 80% for my Family. We\r\nhave agreed with the Consultant that his fee will be paid after his work is\r\ncompleted but the Consultant informed me that there are normally some legal\r\ndocuments to be prepared to enable you to claim the deposit from the\r\nFinancial House.\r\n\r\nRequired information:\r\n\r\n1. Your full names and address as stated in your international Passport\r\n\r\n2. Your private phone number\r\n\r\n3. Your Occupation\r\n\r\n4. A copy of your identification\r\n\r\nOn receipt of your information, I will forward the information to the\r\nConsultant to draft a memorandum of understanding(MOU) and he will be\r\ncommunicating directly with you to send you a draft copy of memorandum of\r\nunderstanding for your perusal before we proceed..\r\n\r\nAwaiting your urgent reply\nBest Regards\r\nVladimir Boatic"
