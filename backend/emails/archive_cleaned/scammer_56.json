        "body": "Hello Mrs. Kristalina Georgieva,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me about this matter. I'm a bit confused though, as I wasn't aware that my funds were on hold. Could you please explain more about the Financial Action Task Force and why they would have placed my funds on hold? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what exactly the Clearance Permit is? Is there a specific process or steps I need to follow to obtain this permit?\n\nI appreciate your help in understanding this situation better.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLouise"
