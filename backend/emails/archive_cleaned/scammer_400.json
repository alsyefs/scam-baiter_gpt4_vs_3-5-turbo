It's quite surprising to hear about this, as I wasn't aware of any such funds being awarded to me.\n\nCould you please provide more details about how this fund came about and why it was awarded to my email address specifically? I want to make sure that everything is legitimate before proceeding further.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what exactly is required from me in order to receive the ATM debit card? Are there any fees or charges involved in the process? I just want to be fully informed before making any decisions.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nEddie"
