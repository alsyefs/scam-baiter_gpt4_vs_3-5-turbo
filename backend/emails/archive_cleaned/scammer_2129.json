        "body": " Attn:\nRE: THE REASON WHY YOU HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND\nAfter waiting to hear from you or your Nigeria partner for a long time now, I decided to make this direct approach to you as my new resolution in order not to let it be if I have anything in mind against you. I do not know if you have asked yourself why each time the release of this fund is approved, all of a sudden, the payment will be stopped or one problem or the other will come up if you have not asked this question or you do not know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.\nSome time ago, your Nigerian friends, I mean the people that introduced you to the project approached me through my dear wife who works with the Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them to conclude a money transfer deal they had with you. They requested me to assist them by removing the original contractor’s name, company’s name and bank particulars from the Central Bank of Nigeria vetting computer and replacing them with your name and bank details in order to make you appear as the rightful beneficiary of this fund.\nI agreed on the condition that they will pay me US$100,000.00 as soon as your name appears as the beneficiary. I agreed and demanded to be paid, but your friends started telling me stories, they even told me you promised to send money to me.\nDo you know that up till now, I have not received a single cent from them and have not set my eyes on any of them? Based on their attitude, I decided to stop the fund release movement because I cannot be denied my right in my own office considering the risk as it might affect my job. Secondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute any contract in Nigeria, although I am the only person privileged to know this information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is that I can see that you are still making efforts in order to conclude this project. Now I am ready to forget the past.\nI do not need the US $100.000.00 any longer from you but a good compensation from your mind. I need your assurance that those colleagues will be totally kept out of this transaction. I know that none of them are aware of my new approach to you. Stop spending your money unnecessarily to Central Bank of Nigeria Officers both here and overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand in it. I personally did the work at the beginning and only I can perform it. Finally,\nI need your promise that no official of the Central Bank or any third party will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my position. Now re-assure me that you will be willing to compensate me and that you will assist my wife to establish a foreign account in your country where my compensation will be lodged. Also a TT FUND RELEASE APPROVAL DOCUMENTS will be sent to you for endorsement after which I will remit the money within 48 hours.\nBest Regards,\nVice President Kashim Shettima Mustapha (GCON)\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA.\nCHAIRMAN PAYMENT VERIFICATION PANEL.VERY URGENT    "

It seems like there have been some complications with the release of funds, and I'm interested to know more about it.\n\nCould you please provide me with some additional details regarding the project and the funds involved? I want to make sure I fully understand the situation before we proceed any further.\n\nBest wishes,\nJoyce"
