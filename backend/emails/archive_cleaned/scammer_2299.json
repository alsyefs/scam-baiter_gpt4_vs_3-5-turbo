        "body": "Hello Dr. Rex Munson Fox,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I appreciate your dedication to ensuring the transfer of my funds. It's refreshing to see such commitment.\n\nI understand that there are many unscrupulous individuals out there, but I'm glad to know that you're not one of them. Your reassurances have certainly put me at ease.\n\nYou mentioned a Bank Draft Cahier Check, could you please explain more about this? How does it work and how can I ensure its safety upon receipt?\n\nAlso, regarding the gift card, could you clarify why this is necessary? Is it a form of payment or something else?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrandon"
