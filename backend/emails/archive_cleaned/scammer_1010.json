        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing this information. It's quite interesting to hear about the review and evaluation of my contract funds with the World Bank Auditor General, Monetary Fund IMF, and Financial Conduct Authority FCA.\n\nI must admit, I've been having a tough time understanding all these financial matters. Could you please explain more about this UNCLEAN BILL ACCESS CODE? How does it work exactly?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the process of transferring funds. How long does it usually take? And what kind of documents would I need to provide?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nVanessa"
