It's truly admirable that you're thinking about helping others in such a difficult time.\n\nYou mentioned a substantial amount of money deposited in a bank in Turkey. That's quite interesting! Could you tell me more about how this process works? I mean, how can someone like me access these funds and distribute them to the needy?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
