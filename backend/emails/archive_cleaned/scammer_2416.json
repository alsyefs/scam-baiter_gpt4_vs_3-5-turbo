        "body": "Hello Mr. Bharat Masrani,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my fund payments. I appreciate the update and the special bonus offer. However, I have a few questions before proceeding.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the abandoned funds? How did they end up in your custody? And what is the total amount of the funds?\n\nAdditionally, I'm not familiar with using apple gift cards for payment purposes. Could you explain why this method is being used instead of a more traditional payment method?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnthony"
