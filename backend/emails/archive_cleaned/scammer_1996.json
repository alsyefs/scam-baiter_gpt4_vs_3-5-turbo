        "body": "Hello Mr. Richard Benard,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the United Nations Box Online Banking. It sounds like a very secure and efficient system for transferring funds.\n\nI'm quite intrigued by this opportunity, but I must admit, I'm not entirely familiar with some of the terms you've used. Could you please explain what the IMF SORT CODE is? And how does it work in activating my online account access?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the ATM MASTER card? How can I use it for withdrawal of money from my online bank account?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nWendy"
