        "body": "Hello Aiyar,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe I've been selected for such an honor. It's truly a surprise as I don't remember participating in any lottery or contest. Could you please tell me more about how my name was chosen? \n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the Scottish Global Award Medallion Promotion? What is it exactly and what does it entail?\n\nI'm also curious about the United Nations Social Welfare and the work they do. How are they involved in this award?\n\nYou mentioned something about a payment for fund clearance. Could you clarify what that means? And why is it necessary to buy a TUNE CARD or SEPHORA CARD OR STEAM GIFT CAED?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
