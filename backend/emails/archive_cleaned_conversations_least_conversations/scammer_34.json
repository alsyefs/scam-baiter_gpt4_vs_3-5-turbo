I'm really excited about this opportunity and appreciate your guidance on the next steps.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some parts of the process. Could you please explain more about these legal and remittance documents? What exactly are they and why do we need them?\n\nAlso, I'd like to understand better how this transfer will work. You mentioned that my name needs to be reflected before the bank can remit the funds to my account. Could you elaborate on this?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJena"
