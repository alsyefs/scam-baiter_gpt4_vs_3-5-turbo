        "body": "Good Day Jasmine,\r\n\r\nI write to confirm the receipt of your mail and I appreciate your time in\r\nwriting back with the zeal to partner with me, I will like you to read the\r\ndetails carefully so that you will understand what we are doing, I am an\r\nAuditor who resigned from the Standard Chartered Bank Plc England, United\r\nKingdom, but currently I have gone back to my country home in Africa for\r\ncircumstantial reasons because staying in England may jeopardize my chances\r\nduring this transaction process because all my colleagues and partners are\r\nwondering the sudden resignation and relocation, so I want us to handle\r\neverything legally clean without any traces.\r\n\r\nMind you that before I resigned from the Standard Chartered Bank Plc, there\r\nwas a particular fixed deposit account containing Sixty Four Million United\r\nStates Dollars that I noticed was unserviceable over a decade, but I keep\r\npassing it over and over at the end of each annual auditing. While I take\r\nmy time to make investigations concerning the owner of the account, having\r\ndone this for a long time, I discovered that the owner late Mr. Clement\r\nPhilip is confirmed dead in an auto crash on one of his vacation to\r\nJohannesburg South-Africa in 2010, though his base was in the UK while he\r\nwas on exile.\r\n\r\nConsidering the facts on what will happen to these Funds if after 15 years\r\nthe Bank and the British Government confirms he is dead leaving no next of\r\nkin, the corrupt Bank Directors with some Political Gurus in the British\r\nGovernment will divert these Funds for their selfish Political ambitions\r\ncausing crisis in Countries they have interest in controlling the leaders.\r\nSo to avoid this to happen, I had to travel to South Africa and went to the\r\nDeath Registry Commission and obtain his Death Certificate to enable me to\r\nsave these funds before the corrupt bank officials would share these funds\r\namongst themselves.\r\n\r\nBe informed that I have gathered all the legal documents that will enable\r\nme to save these Funds and also provide every legal backup that will enable\r\nyou to receive these Funds as an extended relative to the deceased client\r\nafter the Funds will be transferred to your bank account as an investment\r\nFunds. All I need from you is your maximum cooperation, trust and\r\ntransparency in all that we are going to do. Be rest assured that this\r\ntransaction is 100% risk free because your presence would not be required\r\nas I will hire the legal services of a resident Attorney who will represent\r\nyou and go for the claim. Once a Legal Affidavit of Claim is procured from\r\nthe High Court of Justice/Her Majesty Crown Court of Justice in your favor,\r\nwe are good to go for the final stage which is to get an approval for the\r\nrelease of these Funds to be transferred to your designated bank account in\r\nany of your choice and safe location.\r\n\r\nMy friend please feel free to ask questions where you are beyond\r\ncomprehension, but if all I have explained is OK with you, kindly send the\r\nfollowing information to me so that I will know more about my new partner.\r\n\r\n1: Your valid identification copy:\r\n2: Your current address:\r\n3: Your company name and position:\r\n4: Next of kin and address:\r\n5: Your direct telephone numbers:\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of the above listed information, we shall speak over the\r\ntelephone and thereafter I will proceed to initiate the Legal Paperworks\r\nand I shall send the proof of Funds with a copy of the client death\r\ncertificate for your perusal. Once again thank you for your understanding\r\nand zeal of cooperation as I will be looking forward to hearing from you\r\nvery soon. I do not do skype or any of the social media platforms for my\r\nsecurity, I hope you will understand this point.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nMr. Samuel Barcliff.\r\nTel: (+234) 80-6451-8166.\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Samuel Barcliff,\r\n\r\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope this email finds you well. I am\r\ninterested in learning more about the business opportunity you mentioned\r\nregarding the dormant account of your late client.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide me with some additional details about the fixed\r\ndeposit account? Specifically, I would like to know the approximate amount\r\nof funds involved and any legal requirements or procedures that need to be\r\nfollowed in order to repatriate the funds.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and look forward to hearing from you soon.\nBest wishes,\r\nJasmine"

        "body": "Dear Jasmine,\n\nThank you for your response and interest in partnering with me. I appreciate your willingness to learn more about the business opportunity I mentioned.\n\nRegarding the fixed deposit account, it contains a total of Sixty Four Million United States Dollars. This amount has been noticed over the course of a decade during annual auditing at Standard Chartered Bank Plc. The owner of the account, Mr. Clement Philip, unfortunately passed away in an auto crash while on vacation in South Africa.\n\nTo prevent the corrupt bank officials and political figures from diverting these funds for their own selfish ambitions, I have obtained legal documents from the Death Registry Commission in South Africa that prove Mr. Philip's death. These documents will enable us to claim the funds as his extended relatives.\n\nRest assured that this process is risk-free, as we will hire a resident attorney who will represent you and handle all necessary legal procedures on your behalf. Once we procure a Legal Affidavit of Claim from the High Court of Justice Her Majesty Crown Court of Justice in your favor, we can proceed to get approval for the release of the funds to your designated bank account.\n\nBefore we proceed further, I kindly request you to provide me with some information about yourself:\n\n1. Your valid copy\n2. Your current address\n3. Your company name and position\n4. Next of kin and address\n5. Your direct telephone numbers\n\nOnce I receive this information, we can discuss further details over the phone and initiate the necessary legal paperwork. I will also send you proof of funds along with a copy of Mr. Philip's death certificate for your perusal.\n\nThank you once again for your interest and cooperation in this matter. Please understand that for security reasons, I do not use Skype or any social media platforms.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nSincerely,\nMr.\n\nBest wishes,\nJasmine"
