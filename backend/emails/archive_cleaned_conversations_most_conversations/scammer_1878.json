It's quite surprising to hear about the funds in Ivory Coast, as I wasn't aware of any such thing. \n\nI'm curious, how did my name come up in your network gazette? And could you please elaborate more on the reports from the European Union World Bank Auditors? I'd like to understand better what they found concerning foreign debts.\n\nAlso, it's interesting that the United Nation has approved a compensation sum. Could you tell me more about how this process works? How was the amount determined?\n\nRegarding your request for my current address, passport copy and private telephone number, I must apologize but I am not comfortable sharing such personal information over email due to privacy concerns.\n\nLooking forward to hearing more details from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nRebecca"

The UBA BANK director Mr Thiam Kone Is\r\nthe head of the director of UBA BANK here in Côte D'ivoire Abidjan\r\n\r\nVery easy to contact him because he already knows that you will get in\r\ntouch with him regarding your ATM CARD.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contact Mr Thiam Kone Sarata, The only thing you have to say\r\nwhen contacting him today through email is that, you will only express\r\nyourself that you were instructed to contact him by the Order of the United\r\nNation. Then as soon as he received the mail message from you, he will now\r\nupdate and gives you more details on how to go about it to receive your ATM\r\nCARD to your home mailing address doorstep peacefully\r\n\r\nMoreover, the reason why the said SPECIAL BANKERS COURIER SERVICE AGENT is\r\ninvolved in this is because the other UPS AND DHL AND FEDEX agents has been\r\ndisappointed many clients that turn out to be a victim by making use of\r\nDHL, FEDEX and UPS to deliver ATM CARD to the beneficiaries. So do to\r\nsomany complains and report to the FBI, the IMF now decided to make use of\r\nGovernment approved agent so that when such ugly thing happens again, The\r\ngovernment will pay for damages and penalty\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, go ahead an contact the UBA BANK now as soon as\r\npossible today\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow Is The Bank Approved By The United Nation To Make The Necessary\r\noutstanding\r\nCompensation Payment Through ATM CARD delivery to your home mailing address\r\n\r\nMr. Sarata KONE -THIAM\r\nForeign Remittance Director,\r\nUBA BANK COTE D’IVOIRE\r\nBanque internationale pour l'Afrique occidentale Côte d'Ivoire\r\nUBA GROUP - COTE D’IVOIRE.\r\nEmail:    ubafinancialinstitute2019@gmail.com\r\nAlternative.      ubabankplc252@yahoo.com\r\nTel:  +225 07 68 522 164\r\nAdresse géo: 8-10,avenue Joseph Anoma Plateau Abidjan Côte d'Ivoire\r\n\r\nWe are waiting to hear from you to enable us to commence as\r\ninstructed by\r\nthe authorities.\r\n\r\nSINCERELY YOURS,\r\n\r\nMRS.
