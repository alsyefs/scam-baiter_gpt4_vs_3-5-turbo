I was a selfish and greedy person.\r\nBut I had an encounter which changed my belief about life. I have decided\r\nto donate the sum of $ to you, so you can disburse to charities, widows,\r\norphans and the less privileged.\r\n\r\nI was doing this myself when I was healthy but now my health has\r\ndeteriorated. I wanted my relatives to do this for me but they only saw it\r\nas an opportunity to enrich themselves.As I lay on my sick bed, I want you\r\nto help me in carrying out my last wish on earth which I trust will be very\r\nprofitable to you and humanity.\r\n\r\nI will be going in for an operation soon, I want this last wish of mine to\r\nbe an offering to humanity, perhaps Father will have mercy on me. Please\r\ncontact me soon so I can instruct you what to do before I undergo my next\r\noperation. I plead your utmost sincerity and honesty in handling this task\r\nas an honest Christian. Thank you.\r\n\r\nStay blessed,\nMrs. Sarah Davies."
