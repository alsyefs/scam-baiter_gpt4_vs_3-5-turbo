The Official responsible\n for the presentation of your money valued USD$3.7 Million Winning quickly\n granted approvals to their application now waiting for the final\n endorsement from Board of Trustees.\n When our BANK Debit Note was submitted to my desk for final Approvals\n before forwarding it to Board for endorsement, I noticed that there are\n discrepancies as there was no evidence of authorization letter from you\n for the attorney to receive the fund on your behalf. I urgently summoned\n The Official responsible for the presentation of the winning and directed\n him to stop the movement of the funds and at the same time placed a stop\n order instruction on the funds pending until when your views and comments\n are received with regards to this matter.\n And I hereby urged you to call or email me urgently for your comments\n which will be highly appreciated for the confirmation if you still alive\n on sick bed or not at all, so \nwe need your urgent responding now with\n required of the activation fee of $105 which you will send before we\n commence the transfer of your first payment\n $8,000.00 usd immediately,\n because we will not hesitate to continue the payment transfer activation\n with the name of the attorney on claim if no response come from you.\n Moreover, this is your payment information and we will remit your\n payment\n of $8,000 daily as soon we confirm the fee today. \nAlso fill the\n information below to help us facilitate your transfer via MONEY GRAM\n ONLINE CASH\n 1) Your Full Name: ………….\n 2) Country and Mobile. …………\n 3) Home/ Office Address: ………….\n 4) Profession and Age: …..…….\n I’m waiting for your urgent response.\n Dr. Momodou Bamba Saho\n Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Lagos Nigeria,\n Transaction Operation Manager; Mrs. Blessing Chioma Director Money Gram"

        "body": "Hello Dr. Momodou Bamba Saho,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected piece of news! I'm not sure how I ended up being the recipient of such a large sum, but it's certainly intriguing.\n\nI do have a few questions though. Could you please explain more about the United Nations UN Center and their role in this? Also, could you tell me more about the Monetary Fund IMF and why they didn't abide by the plan?\n\nAs for Mr. Williams Anderson, I don't recall hiring an attorney recently. Is there any way I can get in touch with him to clarify this misunderstanding?\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about the activation fee? What exactly does it cover?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nP.S: As per my understanding, sharing personal information like full name, address etc over email isn't safe. So, I hope you understand that I won't be able to provide those details at this point.\n\nBest wishes,\nSelina"
