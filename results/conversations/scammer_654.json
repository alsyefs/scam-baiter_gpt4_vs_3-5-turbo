Could you please explain more about who she is and how she's related to my United Nation fund? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what the fund is for? I don't remember applying or being approved for any funds from the United Nations.\n\nI'm sorry, but I can't confirm the account details you've mentioned as they're not visible in your message. Could there have been a mistake?\n\nAs for my personal details, I'm afraid I can't share them over email due to privacy concerns. Is there another way we can verify my identity?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nFern"

        "body": "Dear Mr. Fenn \nThanks for your prompt response as I hope this message meets you well. For clarity purposes,I,Dr.Muhammed Isah acting under the United Nation directives has duly discovered through our Victims Complaints Drop Box dictating that you are listed as one of those whose rightful Social Welfare Palliative Entitlement fund of US$10.5 Million has been trapped due to bad bureaucratic bottlenecks of the past Government Policy and reasons for the denial to release this fund to you I don't know. But now under my supervision I am here to eradicate bad governmental policy of the past government and for people to benefit from good governance and there is no way you will not benefit now unless you decide to forfeit your funds .You can only confirm the reality by doing what is required of you to do. \nWith due respect to you, we regret the inconvenience the delay in the payment to you has caused you which led to false claim and presentation of Account by Mrs.Maria Davis as your \"NEXT OF KIN\" has caused you .However and as a matter of security, we have taken good measures to protect our email messages and phone correspondences and you can rest assured of 100% safety. Alternatively, you can equally send your details through my direct Phone WhatSapp chat. I therefore implore you to respond quickly and reinstate your Personal Details for our preview and Approval to pay you your fund in confidence . Failure to reply shall compel us to accept that you decline to receive the fund and we will cancel it completely.This Payment Exercise has limited time to elapse. \nAnticipating your earnest reply.\nThanks \nDr. Muhammed Isah \nGesendet mit Firemail.de - Freemail"

I am grateful for your prompt response and the information provided.\n\nIt's quite surprising to hear about the Social Welfare Palliative fund of US Million that has been trapped due to past government policies. I must admit, it's a bit confusing as I wasn't aware of such a fund existing in my name.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this fund? How was it established and why was it trapped due to past government policies? Also, could you clarify who Mr. Davis is and how he claimed to be my next of kin?\n\nI appreciate your assurance regarding the safety of our communication. However, I would prefer not to share any personal details over phone chat at this time.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon with more information on this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nFern"
