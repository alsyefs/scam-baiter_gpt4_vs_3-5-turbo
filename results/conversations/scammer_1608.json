        "body": "Thanks for your prompt response Mr. Douglas,\r\n\r\nHonestly the online Banking will require much procedures from different\r\nfinancial institutions which will involved you spending roughly $5,300, to\r\nsecure all the needed legal documents covering the release of the fund to\r\nyou as the rightful beneficiary, after we obtained  and issued to you\r\npayment clearance from the international monitory fund.  But cash delivery\r\nis more-less better, because the funds will be registered with a diplomatic\r\ncompany which is a financial security institution attached with the united\r\nstates government to take care of any form of cash delivery, to the\r\nbeneficiary's doorstep, and it will only require you to pay the sum of\r\n$1,375 to enable the diplomats obtain the customs YELLOW TAG clearance at\r\nyour city airport nearest to you, and  proceed to your residence without\r\ncustoms interference on their arrival to the airport  for the final\r\ndelivery of your fund, But if you are outside United States, it will cost\r\nyou the sum of 1,365 Euros.\r\n\r\nThanks for your attention.\nMr. John Heasley"

I must admit, it's a lot more complex than I initially thought!\n\nI'm curious about this special training you mentioned. While I understand that I don't have the right to know specifics, could you perhaps share a bit more about what general skills or knowledge one might need to serve as a diplomat in this context?\n\nAlso, regarding the Origin' document, is there any specific reason why my full name and address are required? And what kind of write-ups are usually included in such documents?\n\nAs for forwarding my personal details, I'm afraid I can't do that at this moment. However, I'd be happy to continue our conversation and learn more about these processes.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDouglas"
