        "body": "Good day Sir,\r\n\r\n I write to acknowledge the receipt of your response to my proposal.\r\n\r\nAs stated in my mail, I have been a financial expert for well over two\r\ndecades now, and I have worked with Fidelity Investment International for\r\nfourteen years now. I am working towards retirement within the next few\r\nmonths, precisely by the end of this year.\r\n\r\nI have been carefully handling our company client’s capital fund investment\r\nwith a successful high turn-over excess profit with retirement on my mind.\r\nFrom this high profit yield, I have been able to work out a steady set\r\naside percentage spread over all our priority customers. This made it\r\npossible for me to be able to extract 1.2% Excess Maximum Return Capital\r\nProfit (EMRCP) per annum on each of the Investor's Marginal Capital Fund.\r\nThis is exactly the source of the fund for which I have solicited your\r\nco-operation for investment utilization.\r\n\r\nDo not be afraid of the wire because I will send the fund via charity\r\ndonation meaning there will be no government Taxes (GOVERNMENT IRS)\r\n\r\nI will carefully structure this project based on my experience so that it\r\nwill not leak trust me .\r\n\r\n If this explanation is well understood by you and you wish to partner me\r\nyour roles and involvement is stated below.\r\n\r\n YOUR ROLES:\r\n\r\n (1)    You will be presented by me to our company as an INVESTOR to\r\nreceive the EMRCP fund amounting to $48,000,000.00usd(Forty-Eight Million\r\nDollars) as your annual investment proceeds from Fidelity Marginal Capital\r\nFund.\r\n\r\n (2)    You will make an application for the payment of the proceeds and\r\nprovide a bank account through which the said proceeds will be transferred\r\nto you in any country of your choice. This process I will duly direct you.\r\n\r\n (3)    The transferred fund will be safely guarded by you pending our\r\nagreement on investment pattern or sharing.\r\n\r\n (4)    You will have some minimal financial obligations to perform in the\r\nrealization of the claim as over-head costs will be shared between us.\r\n\r\n At the successful transfer of the fund to your account, the fund will be\r\nshared between us in this ratio: 60% to me and 40% to you. This is\r\napplicable in terms of cash sharing and could be negotiated further in\r\nterms of investment if the investment initiative is coming from you or your\r\nfield of specialty.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions for this, please let me know.\r\n\r\n I will carefully prepare the claim documentations from our office legal\r\ndepartment. On your full acceptance, we shall involve an attorney to\r\nprepare a legal agreement /memorandum of understanding between us stating\r\nevery fact in detail.\r\n\r\nThis is purely legitimate as all documents will be binding by laws of\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to the delicate nature of my work, I will like us to always use email\r\nas our only means of communication for now\r\n\r\nI have attached a copy of my Job Card for your perusal.\r\n\r\nFurther details will be communicated to you\nRegards\r\n\r\nMr Henry Ngosi"

I appreciate your experience and expertise in the financial industry. Retirement planning is definitely an important aspect of life, and it's great that you have been able to generate high profits for your clients.\n\nI understand that you are offering me an opportunity to receive a significant amount of funds as my annual investment proceeds from Fidelity Marginal Capital Fund.

I appreciate your experience and expertise in the\r\nfinancial industry. Retirement planning is definitely an important aspect\r\nof life, and it's great that you have been able to generate high profits\r\nfor your clients. Thank you very much for your appreciation I am sure we\r\ncan partner together on this project.\r\n\r\nI understand that you are offering me an opportunity to receive a\r\nsignificant amount of funds as my annual investment proceeds from Fidelity\r\nMarginal Capital Fund. It's interesting that you mentioned the fund will be\r\nsent via charity donation to avoid government taxes. Could you please\r\nexplain how this process works? I want to make sure everything is legal and\r\ntransparent. *I have the trust or words of a **renowned wealth management\r\nagent with Td bank, tested and tried am sure he will deliver when it comes\r\nto delivering his part without any doubt.*\r\n\r\nYou also mentioned that there might be some minimal financial costs\r\ninvolved in the claim process. Could you provide more details about these\r\ncosts? I would like to have a clear understanding of what expenses I would\r\nneed to cover. To be honest to you the last time we did this it cost the\r\nEMRCP CLIENT plus minus $27,000,00 to complete paperwork’s including bank\r\nclearance papers that was also procured by the wealth manager legally and\r\nlegitimately to the last, actually I was thinking of directing you to him\r\ndirectly so he take it up with you to provide to you all necessary advise.\r\nI assure you we will never go wrong.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I would appreciate it if you could share more information\r\nabout the investment pattern or sharing options once the funds are\r\ntransferred into my account. What kind of investments do you typically\r\nrecommend, and how would we proceed with making those decisions? I have\r\ninstructed my lawyer to draft a private agreement which we will both sign\r\nthat will state all details in black and white first before we go to the\r\nwealth manager so upon hearing from you, I will need the below details\r\n\r\n1.      Your house or office address\r\n\r\n 2.      Any of your valid identification document.\r\n\r\n 3.      You company name and also your position in the company.\r\n\r\nLastly, could you please clarify which country's laws will govern our\r\nagreement? It's important for me to know the legal framework under which we\r\nwill be operating. This will depend where the funds left last from maybe\r\nCanada or would you prefer other country however, I promise you it has\r\nnothing to do with government involvement.\r\n\r\nThank you again for considering me as a potential partner in this venture.\r\nI look forward to hearing back from you with more details.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing from you, I will direct you further.\nRegards\r\n\r\nMr Ngosi"
