        "body": "Dear sir,\r\n\r\nIt is great to make contact with you.\r\n\r\nThis is an investment fund originating from an already executed contract\r\npayment in Qatar by His Highness Sheikh Al-Tani of the Qatar Royal Family.\r\n\r\nHis Higness Sheikh Mubarak AL-Thaniassisted a Turkish company get an oil\r\nservice contract in his country a few years ago. The company awarded the\r\ncontract legally executed the contract and a balance payment of USD500M was\r\nleft pending for payment and this is the amount to be paid to you and\r\nreinvested for 10 years.\r\nThe USD500M represents the consultancy payment due to his highness for\r\nassisting the said contract get the contract and because of the position of\r\nhis Highness as a member of the qatar Royal Family, he cannot come out\r\nopening to claim the funds from Qatar Energy company but he can appointed a\r\npartner to claim and investment the said funds on agree sharing ratio.\r\nWe shall be working with Qatar Energy company for the paperwork needed for\r\nthe release of the payment to you because the transaction with Qatar\r\nPetroleum is a foreign contract payment and, this is the reason Sheikh\r\nMubarak AL-Thani cannot receive the fund under his name which has\r\nnecessitated for us to reassign the fund to you (a foreign national) for\r\nInvestment purpose.\r\n\r\nYou will hold the funds and roll it over in an Investment for a period of\r\nten (10) years before the funds will be returned back to a bank account\r\ndesignated by Sheikh Mubarak AL-Thani.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage of the transaction, our discussion with Qatar Petroleum\r\nis unofficial. This means every discussion between us on the transaction\r\nmust be kept top secret and confidential pending when we reassign the\r\npayment documents to reflect your name as beneficiary.\r\n\r\nThe approval process is handled by our key contacts holding senior\r\nexecutive positions in Qatar Petroleum and some of these contacts are\r\nextended family relatives of Sheikh Mubarak AL-Thani. Hence, we would not\r\nencounter any problem reassigning the paperwork to your name as beneficiary\r\nand concluding transfer of the fund to you.\r\n\r\nWe shall depend upon your full cooperation, participation, adherence to\r\ninstruction and absolute commitment to successfully conclude this payment\r\nwithout any obstacle.\r\n\r\nThe good thing is, Qatar Petroleum shall maintain records of the documents\r\nfor at least one (1) year after payment is completed. This is to ensure\r\nproper auditing of financial records of Qatar Petroleum and also, the\r\nfinancial/monetary authority in your country can verify the source of the\r\npayment to your name if needed.\r\n\r\nSome documents shall be sent across to you, itâ€™s important you have in your\r\npossession copies of these documents which show the source of the payment\r\nto your name is legitimate, clean and not related to Money Laundering,\r\nTerrorism or Drug.\r\n\r\nFor the transaction to commence, kindly fill-in your details below:-\r\n\r\n1. Your full name:\r\n   Your resident address:\r\n   Country:\r\n\r\n2. Company Name:\r\n   Company Address:\r\n\r\n3. Contact Telephone:\r\n   Mobile:\r\n   Fax:\r\n\r\n4. Current work position:\r\n\r\nThe above details are required to get the documents to be signed between\r\nyou and Sheikh Mubarak AL-Thani for the Investment Partnership.\r\n\r\nWe understand that moving the fund via bank to bank attracts much attention\r\nfrom international supervising institutions and therefore is high risk\r\nexposure. In discussions with our associate in Qatar Petroleum, we have\r\nmapped out a procedure to conclude payment to your name as beneficiary\r\nwithout any risk to you or the fund.\r\n\r\nI await your reply.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nMohammed Al-Kuwari\r\nwhatsapp +971556474204\r\nOffice email: info@gulfbusinesserviceslimited.com"
