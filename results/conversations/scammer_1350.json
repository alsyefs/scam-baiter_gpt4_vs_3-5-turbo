Can you tell me more about the case you have with the ministry of works? Also, how did you come across my contact information?\n\nI must say, I'm just an ordinary person living a simple life. I enjoy reading books, taking long walks in the park, and spending time with my family. \n\nLooking forward to hearing more from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnthony"
