        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprising message. I don't recall giving anyone named Ms. Sophia Logan any authority to claim anything on my behalf. \n\nI'm not currently in the hospital and I haven't had a heart attack either, thank goodness! So, it seems like there might be some confusion here.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this ATM card or check that you mentioned? How did it come into my name? And what is this clearance fee all about?\n\nAlso, could you clarify why Ms. Sophia Logan would be considered my next of kin? As far as I know, we're not related.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"

It's not every day that one receives a message about a billion-dollar payment file! I must say, it sounds quite intriguing.\n\nI'm curious though, how did the United Nations come to select me for this? And could you please explain more about the process of opening an online account in my name? \n\nAlso, I'm not very familiar with Steam Wallet Gift Card or Razor Gold Card. Could you provide more details on how these work and why they are necessary for this transaction?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
