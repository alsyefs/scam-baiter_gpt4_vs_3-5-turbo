        "body": "Hello Mr. Gabriel Mike,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite intrigued by your message, although I must admit, it's a bit confusing. Could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, could you explain what this \"Release Permit\" is? I've never heard of such a thing before and would like to understand its purpose.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that there is a control number available on my name. Could you tell me more about this control number and how it relates to the transfer process?\n\nLastly, you mentioned that the only charges fees are in USD. Could you specify the exact amount? And why do I need to pay these fees?\n\nI appreciate your patience in answering my questions.\n\nBest wishes,\nShawn"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Alex Kelly,\n\nThank you for your email and the detailed information about the fund deposited in your department. It's quite interesting to know that there is a system in place to send me dollars two times daily until the total fund of million dollars is completed.\n\nI'm curious, how does this process work? And why is it necessary for the Financial Minister Trust Funds Federal Republic of Benin to stamp sign my payment file? \n\nAlso, I noticed you mentioned that I should use Money Gram instead of Western Union. Could you please explain why Money Gram is preferred?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nShawn"
