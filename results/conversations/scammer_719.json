        "body": "Dear June, \nThanks for your cooperation.  I have read your message carefully and noted the contents therein. However its very important to clarify your question and areas you have mentioned.....the point is that this money came as an over invoiced contract. The original contractors have gone and received their payment leaving behind the excess fund which is the balance of $47Million. It is this money I want to move into your account using your name as a sub contractor.  I have constantly communicated with the lawyer who will normalize everything and drafting an Agreement that we will sign as partners. \nThe lawyer will prepare the agreement and send to you, so there will be no need of face to face meeting, the meeting shall after you are in possession of the fund. \nBest regards. \nElliot Hunter."
