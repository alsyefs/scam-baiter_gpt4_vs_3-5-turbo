However you are\r\nincluded in the compensation due to your past experience so you have\r\nnothing to worry about, do not doubt the reward rather hesitate further in\r\norder to claim the compensation.\r\n\r\nGo ahead and contact the western union office via the below email.\r\n\nContact Person: Bush Thomas\r\nAddress: Western Union Post Office, Texas\r\nEmail: WesternUnionOffice@post.com\r\n\r\nGet back to us when need and necessary\r\n\r\nYours Sincerely,\r\nChristopher A.
