Kehoe of 1200 Fitch Way, Sacramento, CA. 95864 USA; filed an application contrary to your pending inheritance fund. The above mentioned person visited this bank last week with a Power of Attorney given in his favor by your good self, granting him the benefit to process and claim your inheritance of $15,000,000.00 for personal reasons.\n \nHe further stated that the online account details be terminated while the fund should be wired to his bank account with CHASE BANK, Account # 869210755, Routing # 021202337. We have asked Mr. John T. Kehoe to come back to the bank next week to enable us to have a personal confirmation from you, being hitherto the beneficiary. The Board of Directors discovered some foul play, and decided to move the fund to our affiliate bank in Germany.\n \n* OUR OFFICES NEEDS TO KNOW:\n1. Did you instruct one Mr. John T. Kehoe of 1200 Fitch way, Sacramento, CA. 95864, to claim and receive the payment on your behalf?\n2. Did you sign any 'Deed of Assignment' in his favor thereby making him the current beneficiary?\n \nWe are sorry to have delayed your instruction in giving out this fund since we must adhere to the procedures of this honorable bank by making sure this request is verified and confirmed by the beneficiary and his existing attorney.\n \nYour confirmation to the above will be appreciated.\n \nRegards,\nPhillip Moore\nContact E-mail: \nmoorephillip425@gmail.com\nDIRECTOR: International Operations-Debt Reconciliations/Payment\nISLE OF MAN BANK, ISLE OF MAN."

Also, I have not signed any documents making him the current beneficiary.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did Mr. Kehoe come into possession of my personal information? And what steps are being taken by the bank to ensure the security of my funds?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nVerna"
