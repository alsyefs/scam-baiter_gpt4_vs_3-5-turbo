        "body": "Hello Raymond Williams,\n\nThank you for your detailed email. It's quite an interesting situation you've found yourself in! I'm glad to hear that the box has been moved and is ready for departure. \n\nI'm curious, how did you come across such a large sum of money? And why have you chosen me to entrust it with? I'm just a simple person, not used to dealing with such large amounts.\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about this United Nations Diplomatic Agent? What's his role in all of this?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S. I would prefer not to share my personal details over email for security reasons. Is there another way we can verify my identity when the time comes?\n\nBest wishes,\nKathleen"
