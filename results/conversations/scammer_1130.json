        "body": "Hello Mr. Malcolm Holland,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I hope you are doing well today. I received your email regarding the overdue fund that has been deposited to Veritex Community Bank. I must admit, this is quite surprising news.\n\nAs a victim of a West African scam, it's reassuring to know that there are measures being taken to ensure the return of my funds. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the process of releasing the funds via your online banking system? How does it work exactly? \n\nSecondly, why is it necessary for me to provide my occupation, age, date of birth, and ID card or picture photo? Is this information required for verification purposes?\n\nI appreciate your prompt response and assistance in this matter. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAmanda"
