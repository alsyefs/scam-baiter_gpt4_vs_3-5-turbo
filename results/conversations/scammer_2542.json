        "body": "Dear Mr. Mark Robinson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding my payment file. I appreciate the urgency and importance of this matter. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the United Nations Program that you mentioned? What is its purpose and how does it assist victims of internet scams, war, hurricane, fire disaster, and delayed fund payments?\n\nI also want to understand why the payment will be made through an ATM card instead of a bank transfer. Is there a specific reason for this method?\n\nLastly, could you clarify what you mean by \"tracking number\" and how it will help me know when my ATM card parcel will be delivered? Will there be any additional charges or fees associated with the delivery?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nBobby"

        "body": "Dear Bobby\r\n\r\nYes this United Nations scam victims program was initiated five Months ago,\r\nand since then over 700,000 victims of different categories have benefited\r\nfrom it. Now if you are a victim, the commission will process your own\r\npayment through the CBN fast service department, but if this email met you\r\nby accident please ignore. The documents regarding this claim will be sent\r\nto you through the CBN office, and also an ATM Card is the only method of\r\npayment agreed by the bank and the United nations. Yes there is payment to\r\nbe made, and that is the Delivery of the Card to your doorstep, and that by\r\nthe courier company only not the bank. So if you are willing to make this\r\nclaim, please contact the fast Service department of the CBN on this email,\r\nthey will take over from there. Attached is my official ID, you can also\r\ncontact me on phone +2349128062745.\nRegards\r\nMark"

Be informed that I called the CBN in respect of your\r\nown self, i wanted them to confirm to me that they have you in their list,\r\nand they confirmed you are there but haven't heard from you.  The documents\r\nyou ask of are just two different approval documents, one from the court\r\nand the other from the United Nations. I do not have to start narrating to\r\nyou why the Bank has to pay this entitlement through ATM Card, it is\r\nstrictly the decision of the commission to pay through ATM Master Card, and\r\ni must tell you that None among the beneficiaries have complained about\r\nit.  Again note that this program will end on Friday 23rd February. The\r\nUnited Nation has already sent a notification to the Bank to return every\r\nunclaimed money to the commission on the 23rd of February 2024.\r\n\r\nMark"
