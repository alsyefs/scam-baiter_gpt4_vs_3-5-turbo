        "body": "   Hello Beloved!\nI was led to you by my spirit and I thank God Almighty that I found you.\nI am Reverend Sister Marie Fe Mata currently serving at Our Lady of Remedies Catholic Church Manila, Philippines. I am aged 65 years and I have been suffering from Pancreatic Exocrine Cancer for the past 3 years. I was told by my doctor that my health condition has worsened with need to embark on a surgical operation at Johns Hopkins Health Baltimore Maryland, USA. But my doctor has advised me not to undergo the surgical operation because my chances of survival is very slim and this has left me in a state of despair. Worst is, I don't have a child of my own due to my Catholic faith which did not permit me to marry.\nDue to my dying condition, I have promised God that I will spend all my life savings and inheritance on the less privileged and this is where I will be needing your help. I am willing to will all my fund to you which is about $6,150,000.00 ( Six Million, One Hundred and Fifty Thousand US Dollars). You will be permitted to take 45% of the fund for your family and personal use. The remaining 55% will be strictly for charity. I wish that you set up a foundation in your country under my name to serve as my memorial when I'm gone.\nThis cash is deposited in a secured bank in the Philippines and I have informed my lawyer appropriately about my decision to Will this fund to you.  Kindly get back to me immediately with the information below through my private email (\nRevmariefemata@gmail.com\n) if you are interested in carrying out this task on my behalf:\nYour full name...........\nYour mobile number............\nYour age.......................\nYour sex...........................\nYour identification proof....................\nYour occupation.................... ...........\nYour country and city.......................\nNB: I will appreciate your confidentiality and trust in a bid to accomplish my heart's desire, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last wish.\nGod bless you.\nReverend Sister Marie Fe Mata  "

I confronted my personal doctor, to know my fate\r\nregarding the surgery that I am about to undergo and he made me understand\r\nthat my chances for survival are very slim. To me I prefer to forget about\r\nthe surgery since it will not make any difference. According to the doctor,\r\nhis report on my health status was what prompted me to dispose of all my\r\nproperties and I have made up my mind to channel this fund into charity\r\nwork in a foreign countries. I need nothing from you in return other than\r\nyour prayers and to touch the lives of the poor positively with the fund\r\nand I shall bear the cost of transferring this fund. The fund is in BDO\r\nChartered Bank Philippines and I believe I have found the right person to\r\nhandle this fund and use it according to my directives.
