Nonetheless, I take solace in the fact that it is with the best intention and for our mutual benefit.\nI chose you among other contacts that I came across in my search for someone who can partner with me in investment venture. It took a great deal of brain storming for me to arrive at this decision owing to my present predicament, which I will explain to you in my follow up email. I hope that my contact with you will be private, confidential and fruitful.\nPresently I am totally indisposed to carry out financial transactions due to restrictions relating to the suspicious death of my husband, Ivan Pechorin who was totally against the Ukraine war. Before long it would be discovered that President Vladimir Putin murdered my husband. My strongest desire is to partner with you in investing my family money domiciled outside the shores of Russia and you becoming my fund manager. I have no problem investing this money in your country if it offers investment friendly environment.\nIt will be an absolute pleasure, if you would have the wherewithal to handle this project to my satisfaction. Every detail concerning this project would be laid bare to you upon indication of your interest.\nPlease strictly respond to \nanna.pechorin@yahoo.com\nBest regards\nAnna Pechorin."

        "body": "NB: IT’S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT THAT YOU READ WITH BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND\r\nCOMPREHENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nHi Damon,\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your response. As you already know my name is ANNA PECHORIN\r\nfrom Russia, I am the wife of IVAN PECHORIN who was assassinated by\r\nPresident Putin. Initially I thought the insinuation in some quarters that\r\nhe was assassinated by Putin was false due to his close proximity to the\r\nseat of power and mutual business relationship with president Putin.\r\nHowever, the events that followed immediately after my husband died gave\r\ncredence to the fact that indeed president Putin killed my husband. In his\r\nusual style he made it look like an accident by claiming he fell off his\r\nyacht while sailing in the ocean when indeed he sent his hatchet men who\r\nkilled and threw him off his yacht and into the ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore his death he was the head of the Russia Far East and Arctic\r\nDevelopment Corporation. As an expert in natural resources and extraction\r\nbusiness he also expanded his business interest to Africa making huge\r\nreturns to President Vladimir Putin over the years. He was highly opposed\r\nto the war with Ukraine because he felt it was immoral and would also\r\naffect his business interest adversely, unfortunately he was right.\r\nImmediately after my husband died Putin clamped down on his private\r\nbusinesses and froze all our family bank accounts and assets. President\r\nPutin didn’t stop at this as he also put me and my family under serious\r\nsurveillance, seized my international passport and put a travel ban on us.\r\nAll this wicked behavior of his is because he knows my late husband has\r\nbusiness interests outside the shores of Russia. He tried to cripple me\r\nfinancially because he thought I would be a threat to him, he’s extremely\r\nparanoid as a result of his uncountable atrocities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am reaching out to you personally because of my current situation and\r\npredicament as sometimes life takes a turn and only the Creator can\r\ndetermine the next step and destiny of us all. Please understand that I am\r\nnot seeking your assistance, but soliciting for a partnership which I do\r\nhope will be of immense benefit to us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wish is to find a good partner, who would firstly access my family’s\r\nUS$65M in a bank in South Africa. Early in the year 2022 my late husband in\r\nhis wisdom made a private arrangement with the bank to move his money into\r\na suspense account in order to hide it from the prowling eyes of Putin and\r\nhis evil agents, as if he knew what would follow afterwards. With this\r\narrangement his money will not yield any interest for the period of time it\r\nremains in a suspense account. Therefore, I am asking for your cooperation\r\nto act as my business partner and liaison in receiving the money from the\r\nbank for the purposes of investment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecondly we can reactivate the last order my late husband  has, to supply 2\r\nmillion liters of crude oil to a refinery in South Africa, in this case we\r\nwill source for products outside of Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the funds are from\r\nlegitimate sources and well documented. My late husband went through Due\r\nprocesses to ensure the funds were legitimately secured for our family. I\r\nalso have two soft corporate offers that my late husband lost as a result\r\nof this war that should have made us big bucks. All these and more brought\r\na strain in his relationship with Putin, but I never knew it would result\r\nto assassination. Now my family is distraught emotionally and disadvantaged\r\nin business because of the clampdown by Putin and of course the death of my\r\nhusband. Nevertheless I am so grateful to God that I and my two kids have\r\nthis money to fall back on to start a new life once I get away from his\r\nevil grip.\r\n\r\n\r\n*NOTE:* This is what I want us to do. I want US$35M to be fixed for six\r\nmonths in a bank in your country or elsewhere for my family's safe keeping\r\nuntil I have the opportunity to escape from Russia with my two kids. US$29M\r\nwould be used for investment, of which ROI would be shared 50:50 between\r\nyou and me. US$1M would be set aside for your expenses and logistics during\r\nthe course of any investment activity, tax and more as the situation may\r\napply.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will provide you with further information on the feasibility process of\r\nreceiving the funds which is a simple one because I am the ONLY next of\r\nkin. Therefore, my next email after you are sure and have agreed to partner\r\nwith me, shall focus more on the process.\r\n\r\nHoping to hear from you as soon as possible and please introduce yourself\r\nfully.\nBest regards\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna Pechorin."

        "body": "Hi Damon,\r\n\r\nYour questions have already been answered in my last email. However, let me\r\ndelve into them again. I came across your contact during my search on the\r\nnet for someone who providence could point me to in order to partner with.\r\nFrankly speaking it took me over a year to make up my mind to go through\r\nthis route because I discovered that President Vladimir Putin wasn't\r\nwilling to set me free anytime soon. Yeah very risky but I had to trust my\r\ninner spirit to be able to trust a total stranger or else I may die here if\r\nI should keep waiting for his mercy. This is the path I am on now, trying\r\nto take my destiny into my own hands.\r\n\r\nThe business interest of my late husband outside Russia is crude oil\r\nbusiness, especially in South Africa as one of the BRICS nations. I would\r\nreconsider the crude oil business if possible but this can only happen when\r\nI regain my freedom. Meanwhile I will allow you to use your initiative in\r\nother businesses that could be lucrative as well. You can also seek to\r\ninvest some of the funds in about two existing viable companies in terms of\r\nacquiring shares.\r\n\r\nThe story of my life changed in September 2022 immediately after the tragic\r\ndeath of my husband. I was taken to a strange place with my two little\r\ngirls, totally blindfolded,  stripped literally by President Vladimir\r\nPutin's hatchet men and put under house arrest. Up till today I have not\r\nbeen able to figure out this particular location we were flown to. It has\r\nbeen one nightmare after another since then. The iPad that was handed over\r\nto me has no camera or apps, except downloaded music and can only type in\r\nEnglish. I guess they didn't know I could communicate in English. Thanks to\r\na tiny communication microchip my late husband gave to me. I'm now able to\r\nlocate and use email access with the iPad, even though it is difficult at\r\ntimes. So, when you don't get a quick response from me just know that I\r\nwasn't able to locate email access on time.\r\n\r\nEverything was taken away from me including all the documents belonging to\r\nme and my late husband. Imagine that till date the only time I use a\r\ntelephone is once a month, just to say hello to my mother. They simply\r\nbring in a phone with an automatic built-in recorder for three minutes of\r\nmonitored discussion with my mom. My kids cry profusely each time they are\r\nable to speak to their granny.\r\n\r\nVladimir Putin feels I know too much and will be a big threat to him, I am\r\nscared for my life and need to get out of this situation now. I am happy\r\nyou have agreed to be of help in securing the funds in South Africa. I\r\nshall need a couple of thousands from it urgently to execute my escape\r\nplans once you are in possession of the funds.\r\n\r\nAn Attorney will handle all the basic processes like the power of Attorney,\r\ntransfer of ownership or next of kin from my name to your name etc. As the\r\nonly next of kin and beneficiary, this is what I would have done with ease\r\nif not for my situation, but nevertheless you would be representing me as\r\nmy business partner, confidant and fund manager.\r\n\r\nI think it's better to introduce you to the Lawyer at this point, so you\r\ncan hear from him directly, as I'm not truly in tune with all the processes\r\n. My late husband used him briefly in some of his business dealings in\r\nSouth Africa. Kindly confirm with me if I should go ahead and\r\nintroduce you.. It is important as well that you introduce yourself\r\nproperly so I can present you to the Attorney, and for my personal record\r\ntoo.\nBest regards,\r\n\r\nAnna Pechorin."
