These permits help prevent any potential issues or delays in the fund release process.\n\nThe Interpol clearance permit, for example, is a document that verifies the legitimacy of the funds and ensures they are not linked to any illegal activities. It acts as a safeguard to protect both parties involved in the transaction.\n\nIf you have any specific questions about how the clearance permits work or need more information on the process, feel free to ask. I'm here to help clarify any concerns you may have.\n\nBest wishes,\nAntonio"
