First, It is very\r\nimportant for you to know that this very process is different from your\r\nprevious dealings with the fraudster, this is 100% genuine and not a\r\nchild's play.  It is a  once in a life time opportunity for you to receive\r\nyour long overdue funds/payment in person without any upfront payment or\r\nhitch.\r\n\r\nThe sponsor of this project is a seasoned investor who will Carter and\r\ncover every expenses/charges needed to complete this project, before the\r\nfinal release of your funds payment. The investor is only demanding 15% of\r\nyour total long overdue funds payment worth US$15.5M, as his entitlement\r\nfor the sponsorship of this project.\r\n\r\nIt is purely legal and everything will be handled through bank to bank\r\ntransaction, after you have concluded signing the Final Funds Release Order\r\nDocuments in one of the payment outlet.\r\n\r\nYou're not expected to pay any upfront fees like your previous dealings\r\nwith the scammers.  Be also informed that a good hospitality, security are\r\nguaranteed with proper medical arrangements in place, during your trip to\r\nthe payment outlet until you received your funds payment and return back.\r\n\r\nBut you need to take your Covid Vaccination full dose and have proof of it\r\nbefore you'll be allowed to embark on the trip. Also, you are advised to\r\ncome with your proper medications if you're on medical treatment.   Your\r\nfeeding, hotel accommodation and other logistics would be paid for in your\r\nfavor once you indicate your readiness.\r\n\r\nSo, there is nothing else to worry about. Your travel is estimated to be\r\nless than a 5 days trip. Taxi money will be provided too upon your arrival\r\nand further money for expenses will be given to you too upon your arrival.\r\nIn order for us to commence and proceed with the processing of your claim,\r\nyou are expected to reconfirm your details as requested below:\r\n\r\nYour Full Name:\r\nContact Address:\r\nPhone Number:\r\nNationality:\r\nScanned copies of your International Passport:\r\n\r\nWe await you to revert back to indicate your readiness.\r\n\nYours Faithfully\r\nHon.
