I have never heard of Mr. Alan Garnett before, and I certainly haven't instructed anyone to receive any funds on my behalf. Could you please provide me with more details about this situation? How did Mr. Alan Garnett claim to be my partner? And what exactly is the purpose of these funds?\n\nI appreciate your urgency in contacting me, and I assure you that I will respond promptly once I have a better understanding of the situation.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
