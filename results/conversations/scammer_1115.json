        "body": "Dear Leila,\r\n\r\nThank you for your response to my email. I personally sent you the \r\nemail, I would like to let you know that this is a genuine claim with \r\nmutual benefit, this is about Late Mr. Hans Schmidt who passed away 9 \r\nyears ago here in Canada, but before his death with his partner in a car \r\ncrash, he obtained a life insurance contract with Aviva Insurance \r\nCompany which I was his personal attorney throughout and I have been \r\nunable to locate the right relative of my late client Late Mr. Hans \r\nSchmidt since his death. Since the contract stipulates that if no one \r\ncomes for the claim after 9 years of death, that the proceeds of the \r\nestate shall be turned over to the abandon property of the state of \r\nOntario Canada, I therefore decided to reach out to you so that we can \r\nwork together and process the transfer of this life insurance contract \r\nto your name, instead of allowing the state to confiscate this insurance \r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nTo highlight you on the procedure, I have perfected the modality for the \r\nclaim of this claimant, and you stand a chance of doing this transaction \r\nwith me. It is important to emphasize that, for transactions of this \r\nmagnitude; sincerity and confidentiality shall be paramount. I repose my \r\ntrust in you in the hope that once we achieve our aim of securing the \r\nrelease of the legacy to you, that the sharing ratio of 45% for you, 45% \r\nfor me and 10% to charity will not be renegotiated under any \r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this objective, I will depose an Affidavit of Support before \r\na Court of competent jurisdiction testifying that you are the next of \r\nkin to my deceased client, and with the Affidavit in support \r\nconsequently apply to the Probate Registry for the letter of \r\nAdministration of the deceased Estate in accordance with the inheritance \r\nlaw. This is necessary based on the fact that there was no Will left \r\nbehind by my client.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I want you to know that there are legal procedures to follow \r\nin a transaction of this nature; there wonâ€™t be any problem either to \r\nyou or me. I am a lawyer of repute with many years of experience so be \r\nassured that I know what to do and how to go about this transaction. I \r\nimplore you to keep this transaction very confidential to yourself only, \r\nI believe with your cooperation and collaboration we must actualize our \r\nobjectives. I will proceed to the court to swear affidavits in your \r\nfavor once you consent to this project by providing me with the \r\nfollowing information:\r\n\r\nComplete Name:\r\nContact Address:\r\nDirect Telephone Number:\r\n\r\nThis information will enable me to file an application in your favor as \r\nthe next of kin to my late client Mr. Hans Schmidt for the claims. I \r\nonce again assure you 100% risk free as much as I will legally handle \r\nthe process of this business to its conclusion. More information will be \r\nconveyed to you as soon as I receive your urgent response.\r\n\r\nI hereby attach a copy of my ID to prove the level of my sincerity and \r\ntransparency in this transaction.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\r\n\r\nHave a nice day.\nBest regards\r\nBarr.
