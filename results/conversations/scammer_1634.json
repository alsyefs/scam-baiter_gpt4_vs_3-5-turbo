        "body": "Dear Anshula Kant,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must clarify that I have not been in any accident recently, and I am alive and well. It seems there may be some confusion or misunderstanding regarding my situation.\n\nI appreciate Mr. Garcia's concern, but I have not authorized him to handle any of my financial matters or inherit any funds on my behalf. Therefore, I would kindly request more information about the overdue payment fund you mentioned.\n\nCould you please provide details about the nature of this payment? How much is it for, and what is the reason behind its release? Additionally, I would like to know how this fund came to be associated with me.\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of the situation, I will be able to provide further instructions on how to proceed. Thank you for your assistance in clarifying this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nSally"
