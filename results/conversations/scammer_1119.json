It's quite an interesting proposition you've presented here, and I must say it sounds like a unique opportunity.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind me asking. You mentioned that the funds are mostly from stolen government funds - could you elaborate on this? How does this process work exactly?\n\nAlso, regarding the face-to-face meeting, what kind of safety measures are in place considering the current global health situation? \n\nLastly, could you provide more information about the investment intent letter? What kind of details would be included in this letter?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nVivian"

However, I do have a few questions that I hope you wouldn't mind answering.\n\nFirstly, could you please elaborate on the nature of these investments? What sectors or industries are we looking at? Also, what kind of returns can one expect from such investments?\n\nSecondly, regarding the face-to-face meeting, is there any specific reason why it has to be in person? In this digital age, wouldn't a video conference be more convenient and efficient?\n\nLastly, could you provide more information about Lombard Odier Bank's involvement in this process? You mentioned that they don't want to be officially linked to this operation or contacted by the intending investment partner. Could you explain why that is?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nVivian"
