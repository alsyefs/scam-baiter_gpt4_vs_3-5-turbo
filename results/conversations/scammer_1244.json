I am\nwriting to let you know that we received several consignment boxes\nsigned and approved by the United Nations with some different people's\nnames/inscription on the boxes and among the consignment boxes that\nare still in our custody, your name was included on two of the\nconsignment boxes. Other of these consignment boxes are from our New\nJersey branch Customs Office while some are from several banks in\nEurope and some parts of Asia which have all been sent to our office\nhere in St. Petersburg for our office to make clarification that you\nreceive your two consignment boxes in our custody.\nHowever, two days ago (Mrs. Susan Brown) sent us a message stating\nthat she was a family member of yours. Not only that, she also said\nthat you are no more alive, and for that, she made us to understand\nthat you handed over your two consignment boxes in our custody to her\nwhen you were still alive. Therefore, this lady (Mrs. Susan Brown) is\ndemanding from our office that the two consignment boxes be released\nto her since she is standing as your next of kin but we the custom\ndepartment St. Petersburg, Florida is still waiting to see if you will\nrespond to this email, thereby, delaying to accede to her request.\nSo, this lady (Mrs. Susan Brown) is not your Next of Kin?\nYours Faithfully,\nMr. Jeff Clauss\nDirector Customs Department\nSt. Petersburg, Florida"

Could you please provide me with some additional details? What exactly is inside these boxes and why were they sent to your office? Also, how did the United Nations come to be involved in this matter?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in clarifying this situation for me.\n\nBest wishes,\nJulie"
