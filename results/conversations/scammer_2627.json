        "body": "Hello Mr. William Harry,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. Your email certainly piqued my interest, especially the part about not having to spend any money from my pocket till I receive the funds. That sounds like a good deal!\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about the oil that will be used to clean up the funds. Could you please explain more about this process? It's new to me and I'd love to understand it better.\n\nAlso, regarding the gifts for the Officials in the Finance Security Firm, what kind of clothes or shoes do they prefer? And are there any specific history books they might be interested in?\n\nI'm really looking forward to hearing more details about this opportunity.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
