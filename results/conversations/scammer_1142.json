        "body": "Hello Darin Campbell,\n\nThank you for your response. I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nSo, if I understand correctly, there is an unpaid fund that the government has released, and my name is on the lucky list to receive this payment. Is that correct?\n\nYou mentioned that I need to provide my receiving bank account details for the transfer processing. Could you please explain why this information is necessary? And how can I be sure that it will be kept secure?\n\nI also wanted to ask about the timeline for the transfer process. You mentioned that once my account details are received, the transfer processing will be approved. How long does it usually take for the funds to reflect in my account after the wire transfer is initiated?\n\nThank you again for your assistance. I look forward to your swift response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJeffrey"
