It's really brave of you to think about others in such a difficult time. Your son Rayn is lucky to have a mother like you.\n\nIt's interesting that you were the first and only woman to hold the position of governor of South Africa reserve bank, that's quite an achievement! I can imagine how beautiful Cape Town must be, it's always been on my list of places to visit.\n\nAs for me, I live a simple life. I don't have much family around but I do have a few close friends who are like family to me. My occupation isn't as exciting as yours, I work at a local grocery store and spend most of my free time reading books or taking long walks in the park nearby.\n\nI'd love to help out with your project but unfortunately, I'm not comfortable sharing my personal information online due to privacy concerns. However, we can definitely continue our conversation here and discuss more about how we can make this work without compromising on safety and privacy.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
