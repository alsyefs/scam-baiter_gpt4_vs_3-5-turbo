        "body": "Hello Mr. Emeka Osakwe,\n\nThank you for your detailed explanation about the process. It's really interesting to learn about this Wise Wallet account and how it works. I appreciate your assurance that this is safe and risk-free.\n\nI'm curious, though, why do we need to use a Wise Wallet account? Is there any specific advantage of using it over traditional bank accounts?\n\nAlso, I'm not quite sure what you mean by \"Provide your Scan\". Could you please clarify what kind of scan you're referring to?\n\nAs for my direct mobile number and office address, I'm afraid I can't provide them at the moment due to privacy concerns. However, I'd be more than happy to continue our conversation here or through email if that's okay with you.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRichard"

According to the lender this is not just check you pay into your account without confirmation from your bank so don't be scared you're safe it has nothing to do to your account. \r\n\r\nPlease I need you now like never before because you need to be fully involved in this partnership to enable me actualize my dreams. The lender said to me their method to disburse funds is by wire check that will be scanning and emailing to your email box, have it print out and take to the bank for confirmation for payment and that is how other subsequent ones will follow till it completes $170,000 needed. This is my only opportunity and for the loan that is now set for disbursement, it's the lender's  advice that the loan should go through you since it cannot come to my location though I will be responsible for paying back after the transaction is concluded. The loan is just $170,000, but it's structured to be coming through you $5000 daily by installment, as you are receiving it you will be remitting to the agency where to obtain the clearance certificates till it gets to $100,000 which is for the clearance certificates and the $70,000 will be left in your care till we conclude the real transaction incase of any miscellaneous expenses that might arise in the cause of transferring the funds to you. And once the clearance certificates are obtained that is when the real transaction will commence into your account and after that you will deduct your percentage and my share goes for my investment destination as earlier agreed upon. The only information needed to provide for the disbursement of the loan  are stated below. I need you to reconfirm them to me before tomorrow Monday, which is scheduled to disburse the loan to you, thank you.\r\n\r\nPlease below is the required information needed.\r\n\r\nFull Legal Names\r\nDirect Email Address\r\nDirect Mobile Number\r\nYour Full Bank Details and Address\r\n\r\nHere is also the contact of the lender you can as well talk to him on my behalf and introduce yourself to him then ask questions.\r\n\r\nName: Edwin Phelps\r\nTel:      2109205094\r\nLocation: USA\r\n\r\nI will be waiting for your response quickly.\nBest Regard\r\nMr. Emeka Osakwe"
