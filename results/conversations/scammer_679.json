How much are they and\r\nwhy do they need to be paid?\r\n\r\nI'm also curious about the secure shipping company agent you mentioned.\r\nWhat kind of security measures do they provide for such deliveries?\r\n\r\nAs for your share from the funds, I think it's only fair that you get\r\ncompensated for your efforts. However, I'd like to know more details before\r\nmaking any decisions.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\nBest wishes,\r\nBrandon"
