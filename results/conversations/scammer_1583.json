        "body": "Hello Senior Agent Post Director CBP Brown,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate incident involving the US Army General. It's always sad when we lose a brave soul.\n\nRegarding the two trunk boxes, I must admit that this is quite surprising news for me. Could you please provide more details about these boxes? For instance, how did my name end up as the registered recipient of these boxes? \n\nAlso, could you explain what an inc permit is and why it's necessary for the delivery of these boxes? I'm not familiar with such procedures.\n\nI appreciate your offer to have an agent assist me in obtaining and filling out the necessary form. However, before proceeding further, I would like to understand more about this process and why there's a need for me to send USD to agent Deng.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nIda"
