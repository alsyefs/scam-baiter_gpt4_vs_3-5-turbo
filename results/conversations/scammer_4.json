I don't recall authorizing Dr. Wahab Haruna or anyone else to claim any money on my behalf. \n\nI'm not sure how my name got mixed up in all of this, but I appreciate your diligence in confirming the details before proceeding with any transactions.\n\nAs for the bank account details you mentioned, they certainly don't belong to me. I have never had an account with Bank of erica and I don't know Dr. Wahab Ahmed Haruna personally.\n\nCould you please provide more information about this Senate committee on payment and the payment schedule? Also, could you explain what exactly is meant by \"brokering\" my fund?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMayra"
