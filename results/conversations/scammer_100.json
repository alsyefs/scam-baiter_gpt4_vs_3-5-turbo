I have heard all you\r\nsaid and I am willing to explain the details of this transaction to you.\r\nAs I told you earlier, this fund USD50 M was deposited with the Banco Caixa\r\nVaults in Madrid Spain. This bank has a special diplomat that delivers\r\nimportant ornaments and special gift items that are deposited into the Bank\r\nVaults all over the world. They sort for Immunity clearance Certificate\r\nfrom the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and also for non inspection\r\nTag. These two documents shall prevent customs and other security agents at\r\nthe airport from scanning or verifying the contents of the cargo.\r\nI know that this information will be new to you. The custom duty is money\r\npaid to the customs at the airport or seaport to release goods or cargo\r\nimported into a country from another country. That amount paid to the\r\ncustoms to seek the release of the goods or cargos is called custom duty\r\nwhich you are  liable  to pay for the release of the cargo bearing the\r\nfund, This will happen when the special diplomat  arrives at the airport in\r\nyour country.\r\n\r\nI am surprised how you refused to open up to me. I am trusting a huge sum\r\nof money to your care and you are afraid of sending your personal datas to\r\nme. Honestly, I am for real, that is why I sent my work ID and my\r\nInternational Passport to you for your verification. This transaction will\r\ntake the both of us to another level of life. I am prepared to spend the\r\nrest of my life in the United states of america. When I arrive Usa i will\r\nintroduce many lucrative oil deals that will make us Financially World\r\nclass.\r\nHowever, we are scheduled  to move this fund to your country on the 23th of\r\nFebruary 2024. All arrangements for the special diplomat  to deliver the\r\nfund in your country have been concluded. We are waiting for your consent\r\nbefore he will proceed.\r\nLook forward to your urgent response.\r\nPaul Andrew."

        "body": "Dear Johnie,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I understand your concerns about trust, it's indeed a crucial part of any business relationship. However, I believe there are other ways we can establish trust without necessarily sharing personal contact information.\n\nCould you perhaps share more details about the business? What is its nature and how does it operate? Maybe if I understood more about it, I could feel more comfortable with the whole situation.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohnie"
