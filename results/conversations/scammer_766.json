        "body": "Dear owner\nI am Mr.David J. Moyes, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service Inspection United Nations Inspection Agency in Harts-field-Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I discovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from United Kingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed scam\nThe consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it was declared as personal effect/classified document to either avoid diversion by the Shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities.\nThe diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other things are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By my assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more.They are still left in the airport storage facility till today. The Consignments like I said, are two metal trunk boxes weighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment including your name and email on the official document from the United Nations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal effects/classified document is still available with us.\n As it stands now, you have to reconfirm your full name, Phone Number, and full address so I can cross-check and see if it corresponds with the one on the official documents.\n It is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us to repatriate it back to the UK (place of origin) as we were instructed.\nAs I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most importantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection document(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can for you to get back These packages provided you will also give me something out of it (financial gratification). \nYou can either come in person, or you engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery Company/agent that will provide the necessary security that is required to deliver the package to your doorstep\n or the destination of your choice. I need all the guarantees that I can get from you before I can get involved in this project.\nReply me through this:Email:(\neze71819@gmail.com\n)  for the delivery details\nBest Regards,\nMr.David Jim Moyes\nHead Officer-in-Charge\nAdministrative Service Inspection Unite"

It's quite surprising to hear about this abandoned shipment, especially since it seems to be linked with my name and email.\n\nI'm curious, how did the consignee manage to declare the content as personal effect classified document? And why would they abandon such a valuable shipment? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the Non Inspection fees and other reasons that led to the delay and abandonment of this shipment?\n\nI appreciate your willingness to assist me in retrieving these packages. However, I'd like to understand more about what you mean by \"give me something out of it financial\". Could you clarify that part?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"

In that\r\ncase they make a better decision to deliver the fund to you through a\r\ndiplomatic agent.\r\n\r\nThrough our finding, the diplomatic agent diverted the package to the\r\nUnited States, and he was not able to clear some paperwork in the airport\r\nand he lifted the consignment boxes to our custody. I hope with this you\r\nwill understand the position of your fund has stopped here.\r\n\r\nHello, to ensure full access to your delivery of your rightful belonging\r\nand gain full access, you must confirm. Your details or your package will\r\nremain pending until you reconfirm your required information.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I want you to know that this has nothing to do with scam and\r\nany email you received concerning this transaction from another source is\r\nfake because you would have any access to your box without my approval.\r\n\r\nI implore you to do the needful, now that you understand the position of\r\nyour consignment with this delivery, you do not need to be skeptical or\r\nhardheaded about this, I have offered my professional advice on this matter\r\nand it will be in your best interest to adhere with the laid down\r\nprocedures of receiving your package.\r\n\r\nComplete your information today and get started!\r\n\r\nThank you.\nBest Regards,\r\nMr. David Jim Moyes\r\nHead Officer-in-Charge\r\nAdministrative Service Inspection Unit.\r\nTel:  (470) 819 3193"
