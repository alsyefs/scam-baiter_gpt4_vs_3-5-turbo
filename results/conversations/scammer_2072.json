Recently, the bank board of directors ordered his special account officer who managed his account in this bank, to provide his next of kin for the release of his deposit since he operated a coded account with the bank financial department and has no specific mentioned next of kin in his security file jacket with the bank.\nI will share the proceeds on the percentage ration which I know would be pleased by you. Upon a successful transaction which I'm highly optimistic about, you are entitled to 50% while 50%.\n Upon your satisfactory reply, we shall get acquainted in detail.

It's interesting to learn about his success in the gold trade through Egypt and his connections in India and UAE.\n\nI appreciate you explaining the online bank account that you mentioned earlier. It sounds convenient to have a non-resident account with a unique username and password for easy access and instant transfers of funds. Just to clarify, are there any fees or charges associated with using this online account?\n\nAlso, I noticed that you mentioned the possibility of investing in other separate businesses besides our partnership. Could you please elaborate on what kind of investment opportunities might be available? I'm curious to know more about potential diversification options.\n\nLastly, thank you for attaching the deposit slip of the funds left by Mr. Burhan.
