        "body": "  Hello Good Friend\nI have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have your trust before I review it to you because it may cost me my job, so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to review the secret to you. I am Sir Charles J. Colocino, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities here at the John F. Kennedy International Airport Queens New York during my search for undelivered parcels I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from Africa/UK and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box. \nThe consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as “MONEY” rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,800USD. On my assumption the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the John F. Kennedy International\nAirport Queens New York till date. The details of the consignment including your name, your email address and the official documents from the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box.\nHowever, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you provide your full information as Below:\nFULL NAME:\nADDRESS:\nPHONE NUMBER:\nOCCUPATION:\nCOUNTRY:\nNEAREST AIRPORT:\nTo enable me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including the name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to the  United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email address for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48hours upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.\nLastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to transact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me since the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee of $3,800 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.\nI wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will appreciate it if we can keep this deal confidential.\nThank you.\nSir Charles J. Colocino.\nAssistant Inspection Director\nJohn F. Kennedy International Airport\nQueens New York, 11430 United States.   "
