        "body": "Dear Kimberly. Thanks for your response and my apology for the late response.\r\nThere is no risk involved in this transaction. It is 100% risk-free and secured once you follow my instructions and keep everything secret between us the transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect both of us from any breach of law. I know you may wonder why you are the next of kin of the deceased instead of a real relative of the deceased to complain about the claim.\r\nThe deceased had no relatives to claim the funds from the bank and the amount deposited as a fixed deposit was US$40 Million (Forty Million United States Dollars ) the reason why I contacted you is that you bear the same last surname as the deceased which will be easy for your fund claim of the inheritance to be released to you As the Next of Kin/ Heir to the deceased. \r\nSince his death, every effort was made to find his extended relatives and family members in vain. I got in touch with you because I was looking for a person with the same surname as the deceased, and the deceased account did not indicate any living relatives. And for this reason, such funds are seized and confiscated by the Government.\r\nAs his account officer, I received an ultimatum of 21 (twenty-one) days from the bank to present the deceased heir otherwise they will close the account as an unclaimed bill but before I could reach the twenty-one days I found you. You will agree to make this fund useless as a \"stray fund\" after the \"21 Days\" ultimatum is futile if I already have all the assets needed to reach those funds through your help. You will be the next family member of the deceased because you have the same last name as him. That's all I need because I have the related documents and Information that is needed to make this happen except the legal and administrative documents which you have to obtain from the Court and Ministry here in the United Kingdom.\r\nBEHAVIOR:May I remind you that we have a Code of Conduct for this business and our rules/regulations must not be broken or violated by any party. First, we do not have to disclose this business to anyone, whether it's the organization or the agency. This transaction is a confidential deal between you and me, and so it should be. Secondly, we do not have to initiate a third party, neither with or any information about this business relating to an individual, be it friends or relatives to wrinkle that forehead or double claim and to make sure we are only monitoring the success of this transaction.\r\nTHE VOICING:I will queue in your name and information in the database of the bank. The bank would like to inform you officially with the certificate of deposit of the fund, and the legal documents from the court to apply for the inheritance.\r\nThe following information from your side is required to do the needful:\r\nYOUR FULL NAME......DATE OF BIRTH...........MARITAL STATUS..........OCCUPATION..............CELL PHONE NUMBER.............HOUSE ADDRESS........................A COPY OF YOUR IDENTITY CARD OR DRIVER'S LICENSE OR PASSPORT..........\r\nBased on the homework I have done, I know for sure that the application will be approved and the funds will be issued to your bank account by bank-to-bank transfer.\r\nINHERITANCE TAX:I am aware that inheritance tax is paid on the fund. I will come within one week as soon as the fund is in your account so that we get to know each other better and the fund to divide between us. We both settled together and paid the inheritance tax before sharing the fund between us. If you have any questions please contact me by E-mail.\nRegards,\r\nYour PartnerMr. William Duke"

I understand that you have identified me as a potential beneficiary of a deceased person's funds due to our shared last name.

        "body": "Dear Kimberly,\r\n\r\n1. Can you provide more details about the deceased individual? What was their full name, occupation, and any other relevant information?\r\nThese I will provide for you as soon as we proceed depends on the request by the bank for the release procedures because I do not know this person as a friend but a customer to our bank in which since I work there it will be easier for me to get any of his requirements needed by the bank concerning his account and forward to you to send to them.\r\n2. How did you come across my contact information? Did someone refer you to me or did you find it through some other means?\r\nNo one refereed you to me, I did my own search and decided to seek for not only your partnership on this opportunity but other 2 people that has the same last name but you happen to be the one to respond first, I need to be sincere to you and sincere you respond first i decide to continue with you and do not need any other person except if you are not interested besides if my bank knows am involved in this, I will lose my job and also be penalized for this.\r\n3. You mentioned that I need to obtain legal and court documents from the United Kingdom. Could you please explain what these documents are for and how I can go about obtaining them?\r\nThese documents are to back you as the next of kin to the depositor and also to give you the legal right for the claims and release of the money. You will need a service of an attorney to secure them and when the time comes I will advise you on how to proceed.\r\n4. Is there any specific reason why the bank has given us a deadline of days to claim the funds? What happens if we miss this deadline?\r\nThe reasons are that the account has been dormant for more than it should be without service and before the deposit was made, there are rules and regulations to those account due to the amount involved and if nothing is done on the specific time given, it will be confiscated. There are more reasons but the thing is that if we do not get the fund out as soon as we can, we will lose it to the bank. \r\nBelow every of your questions, you will find my answer and note that this a decision you have to take on your own very carefully and not a must because if you are in for this, you will need to follow every directives and adhere to instructions else we will fail the process which I do not want because of the risk on my side.\r\nTherefore this require a lot of time and everything to make it possible because the amount involved will change the life of every our families and need.\r\nI wait your prompt response to enable me advise you further and that is to start by sending all the requirements in my previous response.\r\nRegards.\r\nMr. Duke."
