I'm intrigued by your message and would like to understand more about this situation.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the investment business contract you mentioned? I don't recall having any Nigerian partners or being involved in any such business contracts. \n\nAlso, could you elaborate on what modalities and progress you're referring to? I'm a bit confused as I don't have any ongoing projects that might bring public opprobrium to the name and image of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBreanne"
