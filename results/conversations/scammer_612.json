        "body": "Hello Emily,\r\n\r\nCompliments of the day and thank you very much for your emails that is well noted.\r\n\r\nI really understand your curiosity over my proposal and I wish to give you all clarity on the procedures and procurement of all the required approval from both department of finance and transfer through the South African banking channel.\r\n\r\nFirst let me explain to you, that the fund in question was as a result of an over-invoiced contract which has already been executed and fully paid by the department, right now we want to present you as the beneficiary to the over-invoiced amount of US$10.5M (Ten Million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars). The release and payment of this sum will be done with all the original contract information under your names as the beneficiary, the payment approvals will be issued by the department of finance with instructions to the Reserve bank of South Africa to effect release and transfer of funds to you.\r\n\r\nArmed with these approvals and payment instructions, the Reserve bank will then process the funds transfer to your nominated account. You should note, that the original contract sum has already been approved and payment made to the original contractor.\r\n\r\nThe South African financial code of conduct regarding foreign contract payment, requires the full contract information and approvals from the department that awarded the contract and also from the finance department to facilitate the transfer of funds. Once these approvals are secured from both departments, the funds will be released and transferred to your nominated account.\r\n\r\nYour nominated bank account details will be submitted to the Reserve bank of South Africa, to process the transfer of funds. There will not be any further delay in the fund transfer once these approvals are issued with a transfer instruction to the transferring bank. It is imperatively important that these required approvals are secured from both departments with the transfer authorization to the transferring bank to ensure that funds are transferred to your nominated account without any delays.\r\n\r\nYou will be furnished with all the original copies of these approvals once they are secured from these departments. The reason being that your bank will know the source of funds as a contract payment from South Africa, we will not like a situation whereby funds are confiscated immediately it hit your bank account. This is why all the necessary documentations are in place and transfer done through the legal channel, you should note that since the September 11 incident the American government ensures that every huge amount moving from one country to another is not money laundering or terrorist money.\r\n\r\nI am well convinced that this email explains every step of this transaction and give you better perspective plus understanding.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to working with you on this transaction as I await your prompt response, kindly note that machineries has been put in place for a smooth and safe transfer of funds to your nominated account without any problems.\r\n\r\nFeel free to request for more explanation where necessary.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMr. Dan Zama.\r\n\r\nPartner."

We have to claim this fund through legal way of contract payment by applying for the necessary approvals from the departments involved. The applications will be drafted under your names as the beneficiary to this fund with all the original contract information.\r\n\r\nWe will use the services of a lawyer to process all logistics and secure the necessary approvals that will facilitate the release and transfer of funds to your nominated account. This is the reason why your account is needed because the funds will be transferred through the South African banking channel.\r\n\r\nThe role of the Reserve bank in this transaction is, as the apex bank of the Republic of South Africa every contract payment by any government department, has to be done through the Reserve bank. It is the Department of Finance that issues release and payment authorization to the Reserve bank, to ensure that funds are transferred through the legal channels. So, without issuing these approvals the bank can not process any foreign transfers and funds will leave the shores of South Africa to any foreign bank account.\r\n\r\nLastly, your esteem contact information was as a result of my search through the South African centre for online business and people search.; I have already open up discussion with a lawyer that will assist us in processing all logistics and is now waiting for your details to facilitate the process.\r\n\r\nI urge you to forward this detailed information and also a direct contact telephone number for easier communication and you can also reach me on this telephone number: +2773-7806903.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your prompt response.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMr. Dan Zama."
