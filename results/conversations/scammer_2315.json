        "body": "Greetings,\r\n             I work as a procurement officer for the Singapore Refining\r\nCompany Pte Ltd (SRC).\r\n\r\nWe have recently signed a CRUDE Oil purchase agreement from the NATIONAL\r\nOIL CORPORATION OF LIBYA (NOCL) and urgently need crude oil license agents\r\nfrom the NOCL.\r\n\r\nThis is because the NOCL does not sell their CRUDE directly to the buyers\r\nrather, through their approved licensed agents who act as their sales\r\nagent/middleman between them and their buyers.\r\n\r\n Being a license holder guarantees you a monthly commission of not less\r\nthan 1 to 3 million dollars monthly if my company utilizes your license for\r\nthis monthly crude purchase. I am approaching you to quickly apply to\r\nbecome a crude oil license holder with the NOCL, I have contacts within the\r\nNOCL who will facilitate your application and make sure it is approved.\r\n\r\nProvided you application is approved, and you are licensed, I will make\r\nsure my company SRC utilizes your approved license for their monthly\r\npurchase, and you will receive monthly commission which could be as high 1\r\nto 3 million US dollars,\r\n\r\nIf you decide to take up this proposition, we can further discuss how we\r\nshare the commission between ourselves. I will further guide you on how to\r\napply for the license from the NOCL.\nRegards\r\nNan Cheng"
