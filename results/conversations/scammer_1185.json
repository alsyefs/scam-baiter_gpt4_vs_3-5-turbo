This delay has been caused by the excessive demands for money by corrupt bank officials and courier companies. I am Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F), and I have been appointed to handle your transaction in Nigeria.\nReports have reached our office regarding the challenges individuals like you face in dealing with various banks, courier companies, and diplomats across Europe, Africa, and Asia/London UK. In response, we have taken measures to rectify this situation, and I assure you that the I.M.F is now directly in charge of your payment.\nAll governmental and non-governmental entities that have contacted you recently have been instructed to cease communication with you. You are advised not to respond to them anymore, as the International Monetary Fund is now overseeing your payment. Your name is included in our payment schedule for beneficiaries in the first quarter of this year, as we only transfer funds twice a year according to our banking regulations.\nWe apologize for the delay in your payment, and we request you to discontinue communication with any other office and focus on our payment process. Your new payment details are as follows:\nUnited Nations Approval No: UN5685P\nWhite House Approved No: WH44CV\nReference No: 35460021\nAllocation No: 674632\nPassword No: 339331\nPin Code No: 55674\nCertificate of Merit Payment No: 103\nReleased Code No: 0763\nImmediate (I.M.F) Telex Confirmation No: 1114433\nSecret Code No: XXTN013\nYour part payment inheritance fund is USD$10.7 million. With these payment details, you are now qualified to receive and confirm your payment with the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F) African Region within the next 168 hours. Your unique CODE for this transaction is: 601.\nYou are strongly advised not to remit further payments to any institutions, as your fund will be transferred directly from our source. Any action contrary to this instruction is at your own risk. Respond to this email immediately, and we will provide further details on how your fund will be released. Additionally, please call me as soon as you send the email for an immediate response.\nMs. Kristalina Georgieva Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F)"
