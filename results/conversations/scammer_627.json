        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprising piece of news! I had no idea that someone would claim such things about me. \n\nI can assure you that I am very much alive and well. As for Engineer David Moore and the Barrister, I'm afraid I don't know them personally. It's quite puzzling how they could make such claims.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did they come to the conclusion that I was deceased? And what kind of power of attorney are they referring to?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nArthur"

I hope Engineer David Moore and his accomplices are brought to justice soon.\n\nI'm curious about the US million that has been approved for payment. Could you please elaborate more on this? Also, could you clarify what exactly is a Government approved payee officer?\n\nYou mentioned needing my presence in either United States or Asia. Is there any specific reason why these locations have been chosen? \n\nLastly, I would like to understand better how my driver's license or passport copies would assist in the final and secured process.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nArthur"
