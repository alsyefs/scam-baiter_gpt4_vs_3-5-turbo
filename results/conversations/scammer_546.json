I'm sorry to hear about the tragedy that befell your boss and his family.\n\nI must say, this is quite an unexpected situation for me.

It's intriguing how life can take such surprising turns, isn't it?\n\nBefore we proceed further, could you please provide me with more information about this project? What exactly does it entail? And why was I chosen as the Next of Kin to the late Mark Openshaw?\n\nAlso, traveling to Atlanta might be a bit challenging for me at the moment due to my current commitments. Is there any other way we could facilitate this process without me having to travel?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarol"
