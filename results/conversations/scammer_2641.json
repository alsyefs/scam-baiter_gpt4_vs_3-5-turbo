        "body": "Hello Anthony,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing this information. It's quite interesting to hear about the authority given by the United States Federal Reserve Bank, Monetary Fund IMF, and the World Bank to Global Bank UK. \n\nI'm curious, could you please explain more about these pending Lottery winning payments, Contracts payments, funds, Loan payments, ATM card claims and payments? How does one qualify for these?\n\nAlso, I would like to clarify that I haven't given any mandate or banking details yet. Could you guide me through the process of how to do so when I decide it's time?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
