        "body": "Hello Dear,\r\n\r\nSorry to invade your privacy, I am Mrs. Esther George, the widow of an\r\nengineer, George Hanalee. I am 60 years old and have long term esophageal\r\ncancer. Doing business and making money was our priority, and we didn't\r\ncare much about others. But since my husband passed away during the\r\nCOVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and our many years of marriage were not blessed\r\nwith children, I have found a new desire to help orphans living in\r\norphanages/mothers/women/refugees and foster families.\r\n\r\nWhen my late husband was alive, we deposited US$10,000,000.00 in a HSBC\r\nBank, United State, in the country where my husband worked. I am in a\r\nhospital receiving treatment for esophageal cancer, and the doctor\r\ndiagnosed me and secretly told me what to expect to create the inevitable\r\nspirit. He says that because of the rapid growth and the tremendous pain it\r\ncauses, I may not live more than six months. My last wish is to donate this\r\nmoney to charity because my family and friends robbed me of my possessions\r\nbecause of my illness. I can't live with the pain and leave this great\r\nresponsibility to any of them. I decided to give $10 million usd for the\r\ndevelopment of the community and helping the less privileged. I chose you\r\nafter visiting the site, having prayed on it.\r\n\r\nPlease, in the name of God, accept the money deposited in my late husband's\r\nname and use it to help the less privileged.\r\n\r\nMay God grace and blessings be with you and your family,\r\n\r\nYours Sister and friend,\nMrs. Esther George"
