        "body": "Good day my beloved David,\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been waiting patiently to receive your response regarding what is\r\nbothering me and I thank God you responded. I have been suffering from this\r\ncancerous disease for the past two years and it has consumed not less than\r\n$23,000usd, yet my condition keeps increasing each day with great pain. I\r\nconfronted my personal doctor, doctor John Kelvin’s to know my fate\r\nregarding the surgery that I am about to undergo and he made me to\r\nunderstand that my chances of survival is very slim. To me I prefer to\r\nforget about the surgery since it will not make any difference according to\r\nthe doctor.\r\n\r\nHis report on my health status was what prompted me to dispose all the\r\nproperties my late husband left behind and I have made up my mind to\r\nchannel this fund into charity work in a foreign country. I am a British\r\ncitizen and I was married to a Filipino, he died in a Ghastly motor\r\naccident a year after our marriage and we had no issue before death took\r\nhim away from me.\r\n\r\nNarrating my story to you will make me feel much pain and that is the main\r\nreason why I find it difficult to explain all my ordeals to you, I need\r\nnothing from you in return than your prayer and to touch the life of the\r\npoor positively with the fund, I believe I have found the right person to\r\nhandle this fund and use it according to my directives. I have received all\r\nyour details from my lawyer and I shall be forwarding it to the management\r\nof BDO Chartered Bank Philippines where I deposited the fund and the CEO of\r\nthe bank will contact you officially for further information’s. Here is the\r\nbank's email address ( info@bdochbk.com),\r\nfurthermore this fund would be used to support the less privilege people in\r\nyour country, the orphans and the needy in a positive way\r\n\r\nprovided your informations if you are ready to carry out the charity work\r\nso I will invite my lawyer to commence the immediate preparation of MY LAST\r\nWILL AND TESTAMENT in your name and as soon as the will is ready my lawyer\r\nwill send the scanned copies to you, and make sure you keep them safe\r\nbecause that is the only evidence you have as my next of kin, it should be\r\nkept secret from people that are not related to you.\r\n\r\nAttached is the picture I took at the hospital yesterday, keep praying for\r\nme because the prayer of a righteous woman can heal the sick, I receive\r\nstrength after reading your mail.\r\n\r\nGod bless you,\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs Donna."

It must be incredibly difficult for you.\n\nI appreciate your trust in me and I understand that you want to use the funds from your late husband's properties for charity work. That sounds like a noble cause. However, before we proceed, I have a few questions.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the charity work you have in mind? What specific projects or initiatives are you planning to support with these funds? It would be helpful for me to understand how exactly this money will be used to make a positive impact on the lives of the less privileged people and orphans.\n\nSecondly, what is the total amount of funds that are available for this charitable endeavor? Knowing the approximate value will give me a better understanding of what can be achieved with these resources.\n\nLastly, could you please explain how my involvement is necessary in this process?
