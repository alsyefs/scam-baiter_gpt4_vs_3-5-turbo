He wants you to work on moving the funds and to be invested.\nHe has proposed 40% for you and the rest for him and to be invested on his behalf.\nCurrently the Realized Amount are being handled by a financial expert and trustee who is currently in the Netherlands.\nIf you accept to deal with this I will immediately speak to my principal and connect you to the financial expert to discuss modalities.\nI will wait to hear from you.\nOn your Prompt Response, I will give You my No: (whats-app Exclusively.) for more details\nThanks\nFrom Frank Ocran   "

        "body": "Dear Alice,Thank you for responding to this business proposal and opportunity .As you may have understood the discreet nature of this deal and like I have said in my first email to you,the owner of the funds in question will not participate in this transaction to avoid distractions of political opponents and those who may want him to fail in his bid for political elevation.Your full discretion is needed to invest the funds in any lucrative area that will bring a good yearly return of investment ,eg, real estate etc.Most importantly once in the custody of the funds,you will be required to release a million dollar to him through proxy means to avoid Pandora issues ,these will be needed for his presidential campaign. You are contacted to stand as a partner and authorised person to make use of the secure funds for investment.The funds in question is currently deposited with ING FINANCIAL VAULT in Amsterdam,and its required that you will open an account with the ING bank  in other to move the funds into an account for further transfer to an account you will designate.The secured investment fund is being taken care of a financial expert in the Netherlands who you will meet with upon receiving a power of Attorney from fund owner.He will guide you through the process of opening an account in the bank and the further relaese of the funds to you .I hope my details are clear and this required you to travel to Amsterdam Netherlands once you and owner will be able to sign a fund management Agreement.Please read and where you do not understand ,do not hesitate to ask question.Thanks,Frank..\r\nSent from Yahoo Mail on Android"
