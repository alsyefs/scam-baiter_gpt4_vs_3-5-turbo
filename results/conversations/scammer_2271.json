I'm sure it will be beneficial for many.\n\nI do have a few questions, if you don't mind. Could you please elaborate on what exactly the Task Force Committee on Contract Payment does? And how does this new process differ from the previous one?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"anyway you feel will make you in the receipt of your fund is okay by us\"? I'm not quite sure I understand that part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJoanne"
