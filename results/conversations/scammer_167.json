The purpose of the form is to establish legally that you are the\r\nrightful beneficiary to the said fund. Once these forms are filled and\r\nnotarized it closes the window for any other person or group of\r\npersons/company to apply for this same fund or lay any claim whatsoever in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n2. Stamp Duty and Court charges are fees that will be paid to the court for\r\nthe services they will render in the process of notarizing the forms.\r\n\r\n3. It takes between 48 hours - 72 hours (2-3 days) for the forms to be\r\nlegalized from the day you make the payment for it.\r\n\r\n4. Once the forms are legalized your payment will be transferred to you\r\nwithin two working days.\r\n\r\nI understand your position and there is absolutely nothing wrong with\r\nasking for clarifications where you are  not conversant with the process.\r\n\r\nI will be expecting the filled forms from you.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n*For: OTS SOLICITORS *\r\n\r\n*Attorney  Oshin Shahiean*"

        "body": "Dear Mr. Oshin Shahiean,\n\nThank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your explanation regarding the purpose of the form and how it establishes my rightful claim to the fund. It's good to know that once the forms are filled and notarized, no one else can lay any claim in the future.\n\nI understand that Stamp Duty and Court charges are necessary fees for the services provided by the court in notarizing the forms. Could you please provide me with more details about these fees? How much do they amount to, and how should I make the payment?\n\nYou mentioned that it takes between hours hours days for the forms to be legalized from the day of payment. Is there any specific reason why it takes this amount of time? I'm just curious to understand the process better.\n\nLastly, once the forms are legalized, you mentioned that my payment will be transferred to me within two working days. Could you clarify how this payment will be made? Will it be through a bank transfer or another method?\n\nThank you again for your assistance. I look forward to receiving further instructions on filling out the forms.\n\nBest wishes,\nCraig"

If you wire the fee to us it will likely take 2 or 3 days\r\nbefore we can receive it and if we receive it towards afternoon or evening\r\nwe may not do much the same day so it will be done the next day. But if we\r\nreceive the money before 10am UK time then the legalization of the forms\r\nwill be completed the same day.\r\n\r\nOnce the forms are legalized, we shall submit it to the bank for the\r\npayment. The bank will take a day to sort out their internal processes and\r\nby the next day they will release your payment. The payment will be done by\r\ntelegraphic transfer (TT).\r\n\r\nThis whole process will start by you completing the form and sending it to\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\n*For: OTS SOLICITORS *\r\n\r\n*Attorney  Oshin Shahiean*"
