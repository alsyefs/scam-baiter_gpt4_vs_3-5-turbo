However, I must admit that I am a bit confused about the situation.\n\nI have not submitted any new bank account details recently, so it is quite surprising to hear that there is an account in my name at Bank of the West. Could you please provide me with more information about this? How did you come across these details?\n\nRegarding the account name being different from mine, it definitely raises some concerns. I would like to know if there has been any unauthorized activity or if someone else has used my name without my knowledge.\n\nUnfortunately, I am unable to share my direct private telephone number at the moment. However, I am more than willing to continue our conversation through email or any other secure means of communication.\n\nThank you once again for bringing this matter to my attention. I look forward to your response and further clarification.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
