I don't recall assigning anyone named Tamera Winters to claim any funds on my behalf. Could you please provide more details about this? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what these funds are for and why they were deposited in my checking account? I don't remember having any outstanding funds that needed claiming.\n\nThank you for your understanding and patience as we sort this out.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nNicholas"

Like I mentioned\r\nbefore that this person Tamera Winter arrived at my office on Monday to\r\nnotify us about your illness and that before you were rushed to the clinic,\r\nshe confirmed that you assigned her to come and divert this fund\r\n$4,200,000:00 to this bank Zurich cantonal bank in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe rich now make deals with them to escape taxes by making false\r\ndonations. This is the main reason why we want to know if you authorized\r\nthis person Tamera Winter yes or no. Furthermore, I cannot also let this\r\nwealth be without stating any beneficiary, that will make it go back to\r\nalready corrupt rich governments with millions of less privileged children\r\nin the society praying everyday to be touched by someone to remember them.\r\n\r\nMy dear, please try to understand my situation and carry out this project\r\nwith me immediately. Please let me know your readiness to proceed with the\r\ntransfer either by coming down here or do you want wire transfer. Kindly\r\nreconfirm your full name and content address and your direct\r\nmobile/whatsApp line for easy communication.\r\n\r\nI am expecting your prompt response.\r\n\nRespectfully Yours\r\nAjei Pual"

        "body": "Dear Nicholas,\n\nThank you so much for your prompt response and concern. It's really nice to have someone like you involved in this project. I was informed by Tamera Winter on Monday about your unfortunate illness, and she mentioned that before you were taken to the clinic, you had assigned her to divert these funds to Zurich Cantonal Bank.\n\nI've heard that some wealthy individuals are making deals with banks like these to avoid taxes through false donations. Is this why we're transferring the funds? I'm just trying to understand the situation better.\n\nIt's also come to my attention that there are many less privileged children in our society who could greatly benefit from these funds. It would be a shame if this wealth ended up back in the hands of the already corrupt rich.\n\nPlease let me know how you'd like to proceed with the transfer. Would it be easier for you if I came down there or would a wire transfer work better? Also, could you please confirm your full name, address, and direct mobile line for easy communication?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nNicholas"
