Any\na beneficiary certified 'OK' will receive his / her fund within five (5)\nworking days from the date of the final authentication of his / her\ncontractual date. It is also interesting to inform you that\nin order to carry out deductions on their bills as regards Cost of\nTransfers (COT), Security Deposit (SD),insurance , custom , shipping\nand other taxable charges, beneficiaries will be required to obtain\na Waiver Affidavit from the federal high court of appeal in Abuja,\nNigeria,so as\nto empower this board to carry out such deduction from the total\ncontract/inheritance sum before final remittance.\nFurthermore, certification and unconditional payment release orders\nhas been invested on this board and it involves payment from our\nstatutory foreign reserves of international capital markets (ICM) loans\nfrom (IMF) and the World Bank respectively.\nOnce you obtain a waiver affidavit there will be no further upfront\npayment and this will bring an end to your nightmare and long delay\nin receiving your payment.\nYou are therefore advised to contact Olukayode Ariwoola Chief\nJudge ,Supreme Court of Nigeria , so he can assist you to obtain a waiver affidavit from the Supreme\nCourt of Nigeria.\nFind below his contact information.\nName of contact person:Olukayode Ariwoola\nEmail:olukayodeariwoola@diplomats.com\nPhone:+234-9017592398\nHe will not charge you any legal fee but the only fee you have to pay\nis $125 to obtain the waiver affidavit from the supreme court of Nigeria .\nOnce you obtain the waiver affidavit the paying bank will be legally\nbound to deduct all other fees from the principal sum and pay you the balance without any further upfront fees.\nBut if you fail to obtain the waiver affidavit you will be charged alot of exorbitant fees.\nSo I advise that you obtain the waiver affidavit for only $125 so that all other fees will be deducted.\nWe are very sorry for all the inconvenience you have suffered trying to receive your fund.\nYours Faithfully,\nKristalina Georgieva\nIMF DIRECTOR   "

It's quite a lot to take in, but I'm trying my best to understand it all.\n\nIf I understand correctly, the United Nations, IMF, and World Bank are working together to ensure that payments are released without delay. That sounds like a great initiative!\n\nYou mentioned something about obtaining a Waiver Affidavit from the federal high court of appeal in Abuja. Could you please explain more about this? What exactly is a Waiver Affidavit and why is it necessary?\n\nAlso, you mentioned contacting Olukayode Ariwoola, the Chief Judge Court of Nigeria. How would I go about doing this? Is there an email or phone number I could use?\n\nI appreciate your patience with me as I try to understand all of this.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nErica"
