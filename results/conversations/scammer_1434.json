This opportunity  comes  once\r\nin a lifetime. It might interest you to know that I have been in contact\r\nwith the bank for the past 8 months, in my desperation to make sure that\r\nthe deceased inheritance is secured, the bank has emphatically requested\r\nthat I provide the deceased next of kin. Let me intimate you on the way\r\nforward.  I  must recommend you to the bank as the rightful  beneficiary\r\nand next of kin to the deceased, hence as his lawyer, it is my\r\nresponsibility and in line with the court of probate as amended to provide\r\nhis next of kin.\r\n\r\nPlease note, that  we must observe the due  legal process in this\r\ntransaction. The court of probate made it very clear on issues of\r\ninheritance, in its provision, and its role is to make sure that a deceased\r\nperson's debts are paid and assets are allocated to the correct\r\nbeneficiaries. It is used to  describe the legal process that manages the\r\nassets and liabilities left behind by a recently deceased person.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoving forward, the very first step to take, is for me to procure an\r\naffidavit in your name, I shall do that from the  supreme court which is\r\nthe highest court in the country, with such affidavit, the claim of your\r\nrelationship with the   deceased will be established officially and that\r\nwill enable me file an official fund release application to the bank in\r\nyour favor,On that note, i will be needing the below details from you, to\r\nenable me to approach the court for the affidavit.\r\n\r\n 1. Full Name:\r\n2. Nationality:\r\n3. Contact Address:\r\n4. Telephone Number:\r\n5. Occupation\r\n6. Age.\r\n7. Sex.\r\n8. Position at work\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the receipt of the above listed details from you, I shall proceed with\r\nthe process, Please if there is any part of the message that you did not\r\nunderstand very well, do not hesitate to ask questions, I shall be looking\r\nforward to your response.\r\n\r\n\r\nYours In service\r\n\nBarrister Ivan Kostyantyn."
