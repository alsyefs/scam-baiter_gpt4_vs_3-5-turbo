        "body": "  Attn:Dear Customer,\nI have been planning on how to get things being in order to you and to get\neverything completed. This is to let you know that I have\nfinalized with the bank manager,to credit your ( $1.800,000.00USD\n) to an ATM VISA CARD.So your inherited funds of ( $1.800,000.00USD\n)has been converted and credited to an ATM VISA CARD. This is to bring\nto your notice that I have paid the re-activation fee and the delivery\nof your ATM VISA CARD.\nI paid it because the ATM Card worth of $1.800,000.00USD will expire\nsoon and when it expires, the whole money will go into Federal\nGovernment treasury account in my country here,so because of that I\ndecided to help you pay off the money so that the ATM Card fund will\nnot expire, and Iâ€™m convinced that when you receive your ATM VISA Card\nthat you must pay me back all my money and even compensate me for\nhelping you.\nNow I want you to contact the ATM card office with your home /office\naddress that you prefer for the delivery to be made so that they can\ndeliver your ATM Visa Card to your designated address in your country\nwithout any delay. Like I stated earlier,The delivery charges has been\npaid but I did not pay their official keeping fees because they\nrefused. They refused,the reason is that they do not know when you are\ngoing to contact them and the demurrage might have increased. They\ntold me that their keeping fees is $25 per day,while I deposited it\nthis week Monday.\nBelow is the Contact Information of the ATM office, Contact Person:\nMr.Robertson Lucas, Office Email: (\nrlucas657777@gmail.com\n)\nContact him today to avoid increase of their keeping fees and let me\nknow once you receive your ATM Visa card.\nThanks and remain bless\nBest Regards.\nMr.Johnson Higgis   "

        "body": "Hello Higgis,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your efforts in getting things in order for me. It's great to hear that my inherited funds have been converted and credited to an ATM VISA card. \n\nI understand the importance of not letting the card expire, so it's good that you have already paid the fee and arranged for the delivery of the card. However, I'm a bit confused about the keeping fees that you mentioned. Could you please explain what those fees are for?\n\nAlso, could you provide me with more details about the ATM card office? How long will it take for them to deliver the card once I provide them with my address? And is there any specific information or documents they need from me?\n\nThank you again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
