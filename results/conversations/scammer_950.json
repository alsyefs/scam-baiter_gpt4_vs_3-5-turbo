        "body": "Dear Barrister Gimba Umar Esq,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I appreciate your prompt response. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. Could you please provide more details about the directives of Dr. Godwin Emefiele and how it relates to my business partnership with Andrew Emefiele?\n\n2. Can you explain why the Central Bank of Nigeria requires the company's registration with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and valid bank account details? How does this ensure the release of the funds?\n\n3. Is there any specific reason why my full name, address, private telephone number, and a copy of my passport or driver's license are needed? How will this information be used in the process?\n\nI look forward to your response and clarification on these matters.\n\nBest wishes,\nMartha"
