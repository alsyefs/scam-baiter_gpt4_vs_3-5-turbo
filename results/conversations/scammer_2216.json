I immediately called\nMr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada and explained his matter\nregarding his payment and he personally called Mr. David I McKay,\nExecutive Director of Royal Bank of Canada to reduce the payment from\nUS $ 350 to US $100 in order to help you pay the fee.\nTo this end, you will be interested to know that each and every\nrequired fee / charge has been reduced to just the sum of $100 USD.\nThis step is to allow you to pay this one-time fee and receive your\nVisa ATM card. NOTE: Each proof of documentation for your fund has\nbeen packaged and sealed to be mailed along with your Visa Card to\nyour address.\nYou only need to purchase $100 Steam Wallet cards or iTunes card The\nonly charge you will pay before your package leaves your address.\n You\nwill never pay a penny again as agreed and signed here in the Court of\nCanada that you will never pay any other money other than the $100.in\nany country you are living you must surely receive your package,\nPlease note that you have from now until the end of two days to make\nthe required payment and receive your Visa ATM card.\n I don't want you\nto doubt me about this because after sending the money you will surely\nshare the testimony with your family and with the church where you\nworship.\nTherefore, the days of being liable to pay twice the double payment\nare over, as is the case with some corrupt officials bank in Africa.\nThe payment approval documents have been acquired for the smooth\ndelivery of your Visa ATM Card of US $ 12,000,000,000, 00.

        "body": "Dear Hon. Judge Mr. Richard Wagner,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me regarding the payment of funds. I must say, this sounds quite intriguing. Could you please provide me with more details about how I won the lottery through my email address? I don't recall participating in any lottery sponsored by Coca Cola Company.\n\nAlso, I appreciate your efforts in reducing the payment from $12 billion to $2 million. However, I would like to understand why there is a need for me to purchase Steam Wallet cards or card in order to pay the fee. Can you explain why this method of payment is required?\n\nI apologize if these questions seem naive, but as a dull and gullible person, I want to make sure I fully understand the process before proceeding.\n\nThank you for your time and assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nKorey"
