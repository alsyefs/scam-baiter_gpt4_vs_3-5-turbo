        "body": "Good day to you,\nThanks for your answer and here is the proposal. I hope we can work together on what I'm about to discuss with you, I am a personal account officer to xxx and he has a huge sum of money with us, please do read and understand my email properly. In short, the fund in question was deposited with my bank by a late xxx. He had a fixed deposit at my bank worth $ 35,000,000.00 ($ 35 million) in 2005 for 108 calendar months. The due date for this deposit agreement was the last January 22, 2022. Unfortunately,xxx was one of the fatalities in the CoronaVirus of March 21, 2020, in which over 2,000 people were killed in Italy. He was on a business trip in Italy and so he came to an end.\nMy bank management doesn't know about his death yet, I knew about it because he was my friend and I'm his account officer. xxx didn't mention a Next of Kin / Heir when the account was opened, and he wasn't married or had any children. Last week my bank management asked for xxx. They need his instructions because he has to deal with us. I know that they will ask for xxx. That is why I have been looking for a solution, if my bank manager happens to know that xxx is dead and has no heir, they will take the money for their own personal use. So I don't want that. You have the same last name as xxx, if we work together I will present you as Next of Kin / Heir on the account.\nThe account will be released to you without risk. As xxx's former account officer, I can work out a structure that will allow you to be the next of kin; and the money is split 50/50 if you have the money on yours. I plan to spend some of my share in charity. Take this opportunity to work with me and I will give you the blueprint of how it will work perfectly without a doubt. I'll give you more details if I think you won't give me away.\nRegards and God bless you,\nKathryn Peterson"

        "body": "Hello Kathryn Peterson,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this intriguing proposal. I must say, it's quite an unusual situation you've found yourself in. I'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate demise of Mr. XXX.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind me asking. How did you come across my contact information? And why did you choose me specifically for this task? \n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on the process of becoming the next of kin? What would be required from my end?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJonas"

        "body": "Good day\r\n\r\nThanks for your response, and sorry for getting back to you late as I have\r\nbeen busy for over a week now which kept me away from accessing my email.\r\nRegarding your question, I got your contact online while searching for some\r\nto work with me on this claim, I came across your details and decided to\r\ninitiate a contact. As a matter of fact this claim will be very quick if\r\nyou follow my instructions and it's 100 % risk free. The only thing that is\r\nrequired of you is to keep it confidential between us (you and me) . I want\r\nyou to act as a relative to Mr. Peter, you should read my previous email\r\nproperly. I have the death certificate and all legal documents to back you\r\nup on this transaction, therefore you have nothing to worry about.\r\n\r\nThe bank is called Monetary Choice Bank is a subsidiary of Towne Bank\r\nVirginia and we share the same building with Virginia Trust Bank here in\r\nVirginia. I will give you more information by contacting the bank and\r\nlawyer. All you have to do is email the attorney letting them know that you\r\nhave an inheritance to claim from  Monetary Choice Bank  that the deceased\r\nis your relative, I have the death certificate of Mr. Peter's which is the\r\nmost important paper our bank will actually request from you followed by a\r\nlegal approval by the court, as well as some other personal information\r\nthat you can provide.\r\n\r\nOther than that, if all goes well, when our bank confirms you as the true\r\nbeneficiary of the money, You will need to open an account with an amount\r\nof $ 200 which will be deposited into your new account until the\r\ninheritance fund has been deposited into the account, I am preparing you as\r\nan insider, I will also do the work within to make sure this result leads\r\nto a success. I believe our claim should be completed within 3 banking\r\ndays..\r\n\r\nI  hope to hear more from you."
