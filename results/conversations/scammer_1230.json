        "body": "My Beloved,  David\r\n\r\nThank you for response and concern about my health, I got your email from cosmique technologies website. Since you have accepted to help use the money for the less privilege I will proceed to let you know what to do without any hesitation. From all indication, my health condition has deteriorated so badly that its quite obvious i may not live for the next couple of weeks as my doctor said that is why i want you to handle the funds to reach the less privileged, orphanages, single moms and widows in our society.\r\n\r\nI was married to my late husband Engineer Michael Edward for twenty two years until his death a few years ago. Tragically he died on February 10th 2015 in an Auto accident along side our only Son ( Barnett ) while they where traveling to meet me on my Son birthday. I will never forget that day as i felt the world has come to an end but my Christian Faith with the Help of my Pastor i was able to live again.\r\n\r\nI am an Australian decent but currently in Hospital in Indonesia.\r\n\r\nWhen my ailment became terminal and sadly my late husbands brother wanted me dead to claim all that Mike & i labored for all these years, I sold off all our choice properties and other inherited belongings and deposited the proceeds amounting to $5.5 Million with a Security Company. I crave your indulgence as a God fearing individual and as someone who cares for a better world as much as i do, to take it upon yourself and use this fund for these mentioned purposes, It is my wish that you use 30% of the total funds for yourself and family making sure the 70% balance goes for charity as promised. I took this painstaking decision in other to help humanity in my little capacity before i rest in peace in the bosom of the almighty. what you have to do is send me your full name, address and contact phone number\r\n\r\nI know that my ordeal will sadden your heart but the best you can do for me now is to keep this conversation highly confidential between us because it matters most in my life at this moment and i will never want the wrong people knowing about this inheritance or my late husband's brother. What matters is life after death. I will let you have more information as soon as i have your word and promise not to betray my trust in you.\r\n\r\nI have attached a copy of my picture to this message for your perusal so tell me more about yourself, family and please assure me that you will not treat this offer with levity but will rather give my bequest continued existence.\r\n\nRemain Blessed,\r\n\r\nMrs. Janat Edward"

        "body": "Hello Mrs. Janat Edward,\n\nI'm deeply moved by your story and I'm sorry to hear about your health condition. It's really heartbreaking to know what you've been through. Your strength and faith are truly inspiring.\n\nI appreciate your trust in me, but I must clarify that I am not in a position to handle such a large amount of money or make decisions on its use. However, I would be more than happy to help guide you towards legitimate organizations that specialize in helping the less privileged, single moms, and widows.\n\nCould you tell me more about the security company where the funds are deposited? And how did you come across my email address on the cosmique website?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
