I can understand how frustrating it must be to see people taking advantage of others and stealing their hard-earned money. It's good to know that there are authorities like the FBI, INTERPOL, and other forces working to stop these criminals.\n\nI appreciate your offer to help me receive my funds. However, before I proceed, I have a few questions. Could you please provide more details about the transfer methods you mentioned? How long does each method usually take? Are there any fees associated with them?\n\nAdditionally, could you explain why payment needs to be made using iTunes cards, Steam wallet cards, or Bitcoin transfer?
