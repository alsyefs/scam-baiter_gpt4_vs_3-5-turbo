        "body": "Greetings, Dear Marina.\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for your kind consideration.\r\nI am Mrs. Miho Oshima. I am 67 years old, I attached a copy of my passport\r\non this email for you to be sure who you are communicating with and also my\r\nPhoto before my health deteriorated. I am currently living in Thailand\r\nwhere I am undergoing medical treatment for throat cancer which\r\nunfortunately has spread to my lymph nodes and some other parts of my body.\r\nI was married to Late Mr. Kobayashi Oshima from Nagasaki who died four\r\nyears ago, and I inherited the family's business, my husband and I were\r\nmarried for 31 years without a child, so I am childless and have no one to\r\ninherit my estate when I am gone. I prayed to God asking him for direction\r\non who to donate the funds to before contacting you, and I want you to know\r\nthat I am not asking you for any money, rather I seek for your trust and\r\nhonesty in distributing the donation money to poor Children like\r\nmotherless, destitute homeless people. I have also donated to charity\r\norganizations in Thailand, Africa and South American countries, but this\r\ntime I want to donate the sum of, ( a total sum of $5.5 million USD) to you\r\nas an individual to help distribute it to the homeless children and\r\ndestitute around you.\r\n\r\nRecently, My health has deteriorated, and my doctors have informed me that\r\nI have a few months to live, and as a result of shock, I was hit by a\r\npartial stroke, which affected my ability to walk, talk or do anything on\r\nmy own. Having known my condition I decided to search for a God Fearing\r\nindividual whom I can (WILL/DONATE) the funds to enable him/her utilize\r\nthis money the way I am going to instruct here. I want an individual that\r\nwill use this money to help the poor in the religious houses, orphanage\r\nhomes, widows and the destitute. I took the decision to donate this money\r\nto you because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money, and\r\nconsidering my ill health, I had no choice but to give the money out for\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nI sincerely request for your assistance in this humanitarian work. I will\r\nsend a funds transfer request letter to my bank instructing them to\r\ntransfer the total sum of Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars into\r\nyour bank account, then you will use Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand\r\nUnited States Dollars to help the following people: Motherless babies,\r\nWidows, Disable and the destitute, Helping the poor in religious houses.\r\nThe remaining One Million United States Dollars will be for you as a reward\r\nfor your good work, and I need you to promise me that you will sincerely\r\nuse the money as I mentioned above to carry out the humanitarian project.\r\nNote that there are no risks involved because my late husband acquired the\r\nmoney through legal means, and the donation's funds transfer process will\r\nbe followed legally.\r\n\r\nPresently I am taking treatments at the Isolated specialist cancer hospital\r\nhere in Bangkok, Thailand. I don’t know how long I will be alive, but I am\r\npraying that God should help me.  I am very weak these days and talk very\r\nslowly. I write emails with the help of my assigned lady nurse here Ms. Kim\r\nChan. She is a trusted lady whom I have known in recent years, she is the\r\nperson that helps me access and write emails, sometimes responding to your\r\nemails might be difficult if she's unavailable. I promised God that all my\r\ndonations will be done quietly without any publicity, kindly respect my\r\nwish and handle the whole process confidential, as I do not want any\r\npraises from anyone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I hear from you, I will give you further details on what you are\r\nrequired to provide to enable the funds transfer to your bank account.\r\n\r\nMay the almighty God bless you.\r\n\nBest regards.\r\nMrs. Miho Oshima"
