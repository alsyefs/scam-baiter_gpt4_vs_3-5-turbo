        "body": "Hello Mr. Pedro Sanchez,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I'm thrilled to hear that my payment is receiving due attention and will be cleared soon. It's quite interesting to learn about the EPSANA Financial Unit and its role in ensuring proper clearance of large funds.\n\nI understand that a new online prepaid bank account needs to be opened on my name for the transfer of funds. However, I'm a bit confused about the sum of USD required to set up this new non-resident bank account. Could you please clarify this?\n\nAlso, could you provide more information on how the Bank to Bank Wire Transfer and Bitcoin Wallet options work? Which one would you recommend as the most secure and efficient method?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAracely"
