I must admit, I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message.\n\nCould you please clarify how my name ended up on the list of people who have sent money through Western Union, Cash App, Zelle, Venmo, Bank Transfer Deposit and Money Gram? I don't recall participating in any lottery or sending money through these platforms.\n\nAlso, could you explain more about the compensation scheme from The United States Department of the Treasury? How was it decided that victims should be compensated with funds set aside by them?\n\nLastly, regarding the fee payment via Gift Card such as Steam Wallet or Apple Store Card - could you provide more details on why this specific method is chosen for payment?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrittany"
