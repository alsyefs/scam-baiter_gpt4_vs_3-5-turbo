If not for the check the money mentioned to you would have just left without your knowledge. All they needed is your name and email as the case may be and the rest is as good as done. But I must tell you that even the Team themselves need money too if the see that the cost is clear and you can play ball and you can speak their language. (You know what I mean). For the fact that your email address has enterd the pay and records they know what to do. They know how to source the documents to make the transfer legal. To the best of my knowledge, what Sarah will require from You are Your full name, your house or office address. Telephone number and your bank account details. To procurement the documents you will be required to send money for them but not at at once and I am sure receipt would be sent to you for perusal and records.

        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for sharing this information with me. It's interesting to hear about her possible location in Nigeria and her playful nature. I'm always open to new perspectives and suggestions, so if she has any other ideas or ways that she thinks could be beneficial, I'd be more than happy to consider them. \n\nCould you perhaps elaborate a bit more on what you mean by \"that is the only way\"? I'm curious to understand better. Also, what kind of suggestions do you think she might have? Looking forward to hearing more from you!\n\nBest wishes,\nRebecca"
