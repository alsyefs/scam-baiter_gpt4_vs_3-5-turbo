I must say, it's quite surprising to hear about someone claiming to be a family member and stating that I have passed away. Rest assured, I am very much alive and well.\n\nI appreciate the caution exercised by the United Bank Board of Directors in dealing with Scow Kendel. It's always wise to be careful in such matters. Could you please provide me with more details about the approved ATM Cash Card payment? I would like to understand the process and how I can receive my funds without any further delay.\n\nAdditionally, could you clarify the delivery fees you mentioned? How much would they amount to? And what are the available payment methods for these fees?\n\nThank you for your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJanice"
