        "body": "Hello Dr. Kong Deng,\n\nThank you for your detailed email and the introduction. It's a pleasure to meet you virtually.\n\nI appreciate the comprehensive information about the LEASED bank terms and conditions, as well as the procedures for BG/SBLC. I must admit, some of these terminologies are new to me, but I'm eager to learn more.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about what a Standby Letter of Credit (SBLC) is? And how does it differ from a Bank Guarantee (BG)? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"Leasing Price of Face Value plus brokers commission\"? How is this calculated?\n\nLastly, could you provide some examples or scenarios where these financial instruments are typically used? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRosemary"
