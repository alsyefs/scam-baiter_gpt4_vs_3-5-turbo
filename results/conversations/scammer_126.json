The Programme which was launched by President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) on November 17, 2015 is intended to create a linkage between anchor companies involved in the processing and small holder farmers (SHFs) of the required key agricultural commodities. This very programme was sustained and well executed by my Father Dr Godwin Emfiele and it led to the high level improvement in food production and agricultural revolutions in Nigeria.\nREDESIGN OF THE CURRENCY: My Father the Former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Godwin Emefiele, on October 26, 2022, announced that New Naira notes would be introduced to replace the current 200, 500, and 1,000 Naira notes. Dr Godwin Emefiele said the redesign will take effect from Thursday, December 15, 2022.\nREASONS OF THE CHANGE OF CURRENCY: Here are, however, four reasons the CBN decided to redesign the naira notes:\n1. The Naira note was redesigned to address the issue of individuals who have made currency fraud their main source of income. People who have hidden money they have stolen, for instance, would either find a way to change it by taking the money out or would not need it given the change in the value of the Naira.\n2. The currency change also aims to deal a fatal blow to the growing kidnapping and ransom industry.\n3. The change in the notes is also said to aid in lowering the rate of inflation.\n \n4. The change in the Naira notes is also intended to control the amount of money in circulation.\nMY FATHERS PROBLEMS: I WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT THE ABOVE CURRENCY REDESIGN DID NOT GO DOWN WELL WITH SO MANY CORRUPT POLITICIANS INCLUDING THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT BOLA TINUBU WHO ACCUSED AND CRITICIZED MY FATHER BECAUSE THEY TAUGHT HE WANTED TO UNDERMINE THEIR VOTE BUYING DURING THE LAST GENERAL ELECTIONS IN FEBRUARY 2023.\nI WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT BOLA TINUBE FRAUDULENTLY WON THE ELECTION AND THE FIRST THING HE DID WAS TO SACK MY FATHER, ARRESTED AND DETAINED HIM ON THE 10TH JUNE 2023 AND HE HAS BEEN IN DETENTION EVER SINCE THEN DESPITE THREE FEDERAL HIGH COURT JUDGEMENT THAT DECLARED IMMEDIATE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF MY FATHER.\nI WISH TO INFORM YOU TOO THAT THE PRESIDENT BOLA TINUBU HAS OPENLY DECLARED MY FATHER AS HIS WORST ENEMY AND HAS SEIZED AND CONFISCATED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BOTH ASSETS AND MONIES THAT BELONG TO MY DETAINED FATHER.\nTHE BUSINESS PROPOSAL; I WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT MY FATHER HAS THE SUM OF $27.5 MILLION IN A SUSPENCE & CODED ACCOUNT WITH THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA AND THE ABOVE MONEY WAS GOTTEN VIA APPRECIATIONS AND THANK YOU FROM OVER 4.2 MILLION SMALL HOLDER FARMERS CULTIVATING 21 COMMODITIES ACROSS NIGERIA WHO HAS GOTTEN OVER US$200 BILLION FROM THE ANCHOR BORROWERS SCHEME.\nI WISH TO INFORM YOU THAT I VISITED MY FATHER LAST WEEK AT THE DSS DETENTION AND HE INSTRUCTED ME TO URGENTLY LOOK FOR A RELIABLE FOREIGN PARTNER WHO WILL CLAIM THE ABOVE FUNDS BEFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SEIZES THE MONEY.\nIF YOU ARE TRUSTED, RELIABLE AND FULLY PREPARED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS VERY TRANSACTION, PLEASE GET BACK TO ME URGENTLY.\nAWAITING YOUR VERY URGENT RESPONSE AND MY BEST REGARDS.\nYOURS SINCERELY,\nANDREW OLISHEHIKE EMEFIELE "
