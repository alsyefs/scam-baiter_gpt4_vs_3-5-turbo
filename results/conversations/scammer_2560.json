Could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, could you explain why my box was seized by the Customs and Border Protection? And what exactly is in this box that's related to Africa?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned something about needing a Clearance from Africa. What kind of clearance are we talking about here? \n\nLastly, could you provide more details about the process of claiming my fund? Do I need to physically come to your office or can it be done remotely?\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nEtta"
