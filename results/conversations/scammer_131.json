Once that is done, I will forward it to the\r\nIMF Admin and Fund assessment Unit for due confirmation. Once the\r\nverification is completed which normally takes 48 working hours, the\r\nunsettled payment will be approved and subsequently you will be assigned\r\nwith a top delivery agent/diplomat based on your geographic location  who\r\nwill be in contact with you via telephone to work out the delivery\r\nmodalities with you.\r\n\r\nDo find attached copy of the claims DX-12 Form once again.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your immediate response.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nMr. Graham Bennett.\r\nPayment Verification/Audit.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe information contained in this message and or attachments is intended\r\nonly for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain\r\nconfidential and/or privileged material.

That sounds like a complex process. Could you please explain why there were various interest groups associated with my payment? I'm curious to know what caused the delays.\n\nRegarding the Unsettled Payment Claims form, I am unable to print it at the moment.

The previous unsettled payment was delayed due to some bottle\r\nneck and different demand by some interest group demanding for one document\r\nor the other that may lead to financial obligation on your part. We have\r\nreceived a series of reports and have decided to cancel all payments and\r\nfunds were recalled and a new mode of payment system introduced which is by\r\nreleasing the funds through the proposed diplomatic delivery channel.\r\nHowever, if the delivery process seems complicated to you, we can adopt a\r\ndirect credit to your account through any of our offshore financial\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIf you are unable to fill the claims form DX-12 providing the\r\nnecessary details as requested, I will assist you in filling up the form by\r\nsending me the needed information as contained in the form. Once I have the\r\nneeded information, I will make my remarks and forward it to the Admin and\r\nFund Assessment Uni for authentication and the diplomat will be assigned\r\nafterwards who will be in contact with you in order to inform you of his\r\ndelivery schedule. In most cases this process takes up to 7 working days\r\nonce the diplomat is assigned.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to your immediate response.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nMr. Graham Bennett.\r\nPayment Verification/Audit.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nThe information contained in this message and or attachments is intended\r\nonly for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain\r\nconfidential and/or privileged material.
