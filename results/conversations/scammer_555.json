It is regarded as\r\nthe global lender of last resort to national governments, and a leading\r\nsupporter of exchange-rate stability. Its stated mission is \"working to\r\nfoster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate\r\ninternational trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic\r\ngrowth, and reduce poverty around the world.\" Established on December 27,\r\n1945 at the Bretton Woods Conference, primarily according to the ideas of\r\nHarry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, it started with 29 member\r\ncountries and the goal of reconstructing the international monetary system\r\nafter World War II. It now plays a central role in the management of\r\nbalance of payments difficulties and international financial crises.\r\nThrough a quota system, countries contribute funds to a pool from which\r\ncountries can borrow if they experience balance of payments problems. As of\r\n2016, the fund had SDR 477 billion (about US$667 billion)\r\n\r\nThe IMF is mandated to oversee the international monetary and financial\r\nsystem and monitor the economic and financial policies of its member\r\ncountries. This activity is known as surveillance and facilitates\r\ninternational co-operation. Since the demise of the Bretton Woods system of\r\nfixed exchange rates in the early 1970s, surveillance has evolved largely\r\nby way of changes in procedures rather than through the adoption of new\r\nobligations. The responsibilities changed from those of guardians to those\r\nof overseers of members' policies In This Regard we was able to Establish A\r\nNetwork to Provides Information Relate with Overdue Payments Of All Kind\r\nIncluding PropertIES Recovery, In This Process we Was Able To Recover Sum\r\nof $12.5 Million Belong to You But Only Your Email Address Noted On Contact\r\nof The Beneficiary,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the Reason For The Final and Only Payment That is Required to Be\r\nPaid in This Transaction to enable us have this Fund Transferred to you\r\nImmediately,\r\n\r\n(1) Deposit Fees (IMF INTERNATIONAL CLEARANCE CERTIFICATE)\r\n(2) Shipping Fees ( This is the charge for shipping the ATM VISA CARD to\r\nyour home address)\r\n(3) Bank Transfer is Also Our Next Option Of Transaction to enable us have\r\nthis Transaction completed with you,\r\n\r\nAccording to Our Confirmation with the FBI In the Process of Completing\r\nThis Transaction we Acknowledged that sum of $285 Dollars is the only and\r\nlast payment you have to pay in this transaction to enable us have this\r\nFund Transferred to you through ( ATM Card/Bank Transfer )\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU FROM MR.
