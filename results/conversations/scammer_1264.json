        "body": "Hello H. Nash,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. It's quite a surprise to hear from the President and Chief Executive Officer of a bank! I'm doing fine, thank you for asking, and my family is also doing well.\n\nIt's interesting to hear that you'll be visiting banks in my state. May I ask what kind of businesses are being discussed? \n\nRegarding the fund transfer, it sounds like an enormous amount! However, I'm a bit confused about some details. Could you please clarify how much exactly is the sum owed to me? And why was it compiled and submitted to your desk?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about this ATM card? How does it work exactly? And why do I need to send a fee for it?\n\nI appreciate your patience in answering these questions. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
