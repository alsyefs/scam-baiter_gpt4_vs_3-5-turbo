It's truly inspiring to see such selflessness, especially in the face of adversity.\n\nI want to assure you that I am committed to helping with this charity project. However, I must admit that I'm not very experienced in handling large sums of money or dealing with banks on such matters. Could you perhaps guide me through the process? \n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the charity work you have in mind? Are there specific causes or organizations that are close to your heart?\n\nAs for my contact information, I would prefer not to share it over email due to privacy concerns. Is there another way we can proceed without sharing personal details online?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrank"
