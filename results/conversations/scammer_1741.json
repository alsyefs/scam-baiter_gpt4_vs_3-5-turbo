        "body": "Thank you for your quick response to my proposal. As a senior active\r\nofficer in my company, I oversee all available items in the storage\r\nfacility, such as baggage consignment boxes and more.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as I said in my previous email, I told you that I was at the\r\nairport to represent my company for clearance of some oversized items.\r\n\r\nIn the process, I accidentally encountered the diplomat. We both introduced\r\nourselves as the senior officers in my company and the storage facility of\r\nall items, baggage consignment boxes, other delivery belongings, etc. The\r\ndiplomat contracted me to complete the formality with the U.S Customs and\r\nLaw Enforcement for safety to avoid swindling and get the consignment box\r\ndeposited in our safe storage warehouse. I am still waiting to hear news or\r\nif someone applied to release the consignment box. to cut the story short.\r\nI went to conduct an X-ray scan without anyone in the company's knowledge.\r\nThe report revealed an undisclosed sum of approximately $13.9 Million\r\nUnited States dollars. However, the consignee did not properly declare the\r\nContents of the metal consignment box as “MONEY”; instead, it was reported\r\nas a personal effect.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would like us to transact this as a deal: 70% for you and 30% for\r\nme. As the senior officer of my company, I have all the resources in my\r\npossession to make this work for the consignment box to be delivered. I\r\nhave all the necessary resources to make this work for the consignment box\r\nto be delivered to your location within 2 to 3 working days. All I want is\r\nyour trust and cooperation. In your next reply, could you provide the\r\ndetails below?\r\n\r\n(1) Your exact full name (First Name, Middle Name, and Last name)\r\n(2) Your Home Address\r\n(3) Your telephone numbers\r\n\r\nI need to re-harmonize them with our company's delivery records. PLEASE\r\nSEND THEM IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU GET THIS EMAIL.\r\n\r\nIf you choose not to do this transaction with me, our company C.E.O. will\r\nturn your consignment box over to the U.S. Treasury.

I must say, it's not every day that one hears about such a discovery.\n\nI'm curious though, how did the consignee manage to declare the contents of the metal box as personal effects instead of money? That seems like quite a significant oversight on their part.\n\nAlso, I'm intrigued by your mention of having all the necessary resources to make this work. Could you perhaps elaborate more on what these resources are and how they would be utilized in this process?\n\nAs for your request for my personal details, I'm afraid I can't provide them at this time. However, I am interested in continuing our conversation and learning more about this unique situation.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nMargaret"
