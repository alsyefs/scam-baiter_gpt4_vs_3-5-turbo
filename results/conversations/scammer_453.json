        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't aware that there was a case being handled in the HIGH COURT OF TEXAS concerning funds related to me. \n\nTo answer your questions, I don't recall receiving any money from someone named Erica. As far as I know, no money has been received by me through either bank or courier. Also, I'm not sure about the date or year you're referring to and which authority approved the file.\n\nI would like to understand more about this situation. Could you please provide more details about this case? What is it exactly about and how am I involved? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nElizabeth"
