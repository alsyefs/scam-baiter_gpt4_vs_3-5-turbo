There is no meaningful economic activities going on in Syria and there will be none for the foreseeable future even if the war stops today as it will take more than four decades to re-build our infrastructure and our economy . \nI want my daughter to emigrate to your country but not as a refugee rather as an investor, as I still have a substantial part of my cash holdings intact. For me, I am seriously sick for eight months now.   I have Chronic Lymphoid Leukaemia and according to my doctors I have no much time to live. This is why I found it wise to contact a business person in your country to help me since this country wont be safe for my 11 years old daughter . \nI wish for a prompt response from you regarding my letter her. Contact me here office@chgcc.com \n \nWarm regards , \nMr.Ashraf \nEmail- office@chgcc.com NOTE: If you received this message in your SPAM/JUNK folder, that is because of the restrictions implemented by your Internet Service Provider, treat it genuinely."
