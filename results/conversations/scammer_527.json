It's not every day that one receives an email from a person of your stature, let alone a donation! I wholeheartedly agree with your sentiment about making the world a better place by giving and solving each other's problems.\n\nI visited the webpage as you suggested and found your interview quite enlightening. Your philanthropic efforts are indeed commendable.\n\nI am curious though, how did you come across my email address? And why did you choose me specifically for this donation? I'm just an ordinary person, after all.\n\nAs for using the money wisely, rest assured that I will do my best to help alleviate poverty in my region. However, could you please provide more details about how this process works? How will the funds be transferred to me?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJuan"
