So, if I understand correctly, the attorney is the one who signs these documents on behalf of the main owner of the funds? \n\nCould you please explain a bit more about how this process works? For instance, what kind of documents are we talking about here? And why is it necessary for an attorney to sign them instead of the actual owner?\n\nI'm really curious to know more about this. Thanks again for enlightening me!\n\nBest wishes,\nDean"
