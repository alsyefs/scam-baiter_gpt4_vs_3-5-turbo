He died in a crash with his immediate family which includes his\r\ndaughter the documented Next of Kin and as such the funds\r\nnow have an open beneficiary mandate in the Bank,\r\n\r\nThis means that any person with access to the documents can act as the\r\nNEXT OF KIN to the deceased and claim the inheritance funds without any\r\nrisk involved.

All I require is your honest cooperation to\r\nenable us to see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will\r\nbe executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you\r\nfrom any breach of the law.\r\n\r\nYou are therefore requested to furnish me with the following details to\r\nenable me process all the vital documents and submit to the bank\r\nfor approval /transfer of the fund to your nominated bank account .\r\n\r\n(1) Your full name\r\n(2) Your full address\n(3) Your Whatsapp Mobile number\r\n(4) Your identity proof\r\n\r\nKindly revert back on receipt.\r\nCordially Yours,\r\nCollin Hamilton\r\n====================="
