        "body": "Dear Laura,\r\n\r\nHow are you and your family?\r\n\r\nI am writing to you on the directive of Mr. Wilson Ogunleye in the DAM\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nI was my late *Liu Liao* personal lawyer and I managed his legal affairs\r\nover the period of time he was alive in this country.\r\n\r\nMy late client died of heart attack because members of his family were\r\ninvolved in the tsunami disaster in Indonesia and none of his relative is\r\nalive today to claim his project payment on the contract he executed in the\r\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation here in Nigeria and with your\r\ncooperation, I can present and file in your name as the due beneficiary and\r\nnext of kin to my late client for the release and transfer the fund to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Before my client’s death, he made no will and as such this fund has been\r\nin the bank unclaimed. The bank has contacted me as his lawyer to produce\r\nhis next of kin otherwise the fund will be sent to the government treasury\r\nand this I do not want to happen.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the late Mrs. Obinaju that provided your contact which she presented\r\nto the NNPC and the intention was to use it hold on for the search of the\r\nnext of kin and it was because no name was found to replace you that it now\r\nget to the new management the president contracted to handle the payment of\r\nthe debts which is the DAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, I tried my possible best and without success to locate any relative of\r\nmy late client.\r\n\r\nI wish you to stand in as the next of kin and I will use my position to\r\nsecure legal documents that will ensure the fund is legally transferred to\r\nyou for our mutual benefit. With the legal papers approved in your name, no\r\none else can come forward to lay claim to this fund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresently, I am in possession of all related documents of the contract in\r\nNNPC, and considering the present state of affairs, I will make them\r\navailable to you only when you agree to work with us as partners. It was\r\nonly mr. Wilson and I are into this transaction with you so please always\r\nkeep it confidential. I want this done so that I can use a good part of my\r\nshare for helping the poor and the needy and for charity works.\r\n\r\nYou shall receive 30% for your assistance while Mr. Wilson and I share the\r\nremaining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall require from you, your FULL NAME and CONTACT ADDRESS with TELEPHONE\r\nNUMBERS to start the process of claim in this regard and upon the receipt\r\nof your information i shall go straight to DAM office and file in your\r\ndetails and already we have a good financial expert in like Mr. Wilson who\r\nwill handle the documentation in Dam to ensure the funds is release and\r\ntransfer in your name\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI assure that the process will be done legally and transparently without\r\nany breach of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI wait to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSincerely yours.\r\n\r\nBarr.

It's always a tragedy when such disasters strike and lives are lost.\n\nYour proposal is quite intriguing, although I must admit it's a bit overwhelming for me to comprehend fully. Could you please clarify how exactly I fit into this situation? How did Mrs. Obinaju come across my contact information?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the legal documents that need to be secured in my name?

        "body": "Dear Laura,\r\nYour mail was well received, and the contents fully understood.\r\nMy client then has high blood pressure which he suffers until his death.\r\nReally, pathetic imagine what it seems when one loses the entire family at\r\nstretch in unfortunate circumstances. Anyway, that has been forgotten.\r\n\r\nAs I am writing to you already you have been fit in as the next of kin for\r\nthe late Mr. Liu. Your contact information is already in the space\r\ndesignated for the next of kin.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I was my late client’s personal lawyer and I managed his legal\r\naffairs over the period of time he was alive and therefore no one will ever\r\ndoubt when I confirm you as the next of kin.\r\n\r\nMrs. Louisa Obinaju is now deceased. She died a few years ago. Late woman\r\nhas lived most of her life in Europe. Maybe that was where she met you. The\r\nname she is known to us is Mrs. Obinaju. She was the one who presented your\r\ncontact to me which, like I stated, is a space holder as I continue\r\nsearching for the next of kin and to avoid the government confiscating the\r\nfunds into government treasure.\r\n\r\nIn my capacity, I am giving you a 100% guarantee of the successful\r\nconclusion of this transaction immediately the much needed documents are\r\nsecured from the court.\r\n\r\nThe court automatically will not be involved in illegality; hence you need\r\nnot entertain any fears whatsoever. Everything will be carried out within\r\nthe ambit of the law, thereby giving you full protection.\r\n\r\nI will use your information which I am expecting you to send to me present\r\nat the court to enable them grant you the right as the next of kin to this\r\nfund, which I am certain that we will get the nod of the court to give you\r\nthe legal backing as the legally recognized next of kin.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, once we get these documents from the court, I shall take it to\r\nthe NNPC for authentication before I proceed with it to Dam to release the\r\ninheritance to you into any account nominated by you. I am certain that\r\nthey shall be released without hesitation since we have presented the due\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nThe only responsibility by you will be to provide the information I require\r\nfor the process I want to engage the court for your legal approval as the\r\nnext of kin. It is here we require your maximum co-operation.\r\n\r\nThe Dam is the office the government placed as the authority that is to\r\nprocess the debt owned by the ministries here for payment to its\r\nbeneficiaries.\r\nThere were projects which government departments awarded to foreigners and\r\nwhich were executed and payment sorted for, it was the responsibility of\r\nthe Dam when the president through the offices that awarded the project\r\npassed the instruction of the payment the DAM will then process the\r\npayment. And that was what they were doing about this particular\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson Oguleye was a member of that management Dam and with him at the\r\nhelm of affairs we are assured to achieve our purpose in getting this fund\r\nreleased to your account. He was drawn from the Central bank where he works\r\nto Dam as one representing the Central Bank in the payment of the debts.\r\nWith this tell me how Wilson will give approval of our project and the CBN\r\nwill not honour it or the other associated offices.\r\n\r\nI shall require from you, your FULL NAME and CONTACT ADDRESS with TELEPHONE\r\nNUMBERS to start the process of claim.\r\n\r\nPlease don’t fail to let me know if you still require more clarification\r\nfrom my side.\nRegards,\r\nSmith."

All his life had\r\nbeen in Europe and she even died in the UK. But I hope this is not all that\r\nimportant for now than to commence on how we have the fund received in your\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe documents we expected to secure from the court are mainly the approval\r\nby the court in certifying you as the next of kin to my late client. A\r\ncertificate of the approval of you as the next of kin will be issued to us\r\nby the court which we are to present to the NNPC and Dam only. Only Dam and\r\nNNPC need the approval because their authentication on the next of kin is\r\nalready acceptable by the other departments or offices associated with the\r\npayment.\r\nIf the documents are secured from the court, copies of it will be sent to\r\nyou for perusal before being submitted to the necessary offices.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAM is Debt Appropriation Management. It is responsible for file\r\nverification of all payments approved by the president for payment as debt\r\nowed on projects executed in this country. It is the dam that will check if\r\nthe claim for any debt by the beneficiary the president presented for\r\npayment is authentic and needs to be paid to that beneficiary. The work\r\nhand in hand with the offices where the project is awarded and executed.\r\nTheir approval when given by the dam will be confirmed by the DPVB before\r\nthe Finance Ministry will give the allocation of the payment to CBN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson's real office is in the Central Bank; he was one of the\r\ndirectors in the Apex bank before the President brought him to Dam to be\r\nthe amount the selected officers by the government to handle all payments\r\ninvolving projects executed. Therefore, he must have authority in the Dam\r\nand in the Central bank that is what I meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NNPC, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation was the place the\r\ncontract was awarded to my late client. The contract was for the\r\nrefurbishing work he did in the oil refinery in Eleme in Rivers State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope your questions are answered."
