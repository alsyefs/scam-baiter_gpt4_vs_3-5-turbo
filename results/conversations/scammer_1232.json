        "body": "  Dear Friend\nI am very sorry for the informal manner in which this letter is reaching you, as this was necessitated by my urgent need to reach you.I therefore mail on a positive note anticipating your kind consideration, and plead for your time and understanding in this.First, my name is Mrs. Janet Kumah. I am the wife of late Mr. Kwesi Micheal Kumah, who was a very successful business tycoon based here in Ghana.He was the Chairman Executive Officer of LA-PALM ROYAL BEACH HOTEL,C.E.O. KUMAT HOLDINGS and a host of other companies died last month at the age of 48 years after a brief-illness at the Kolebu Teaching Hospital here in Ghana.\nIn our world today, such a manner of approach may not be acceptable or very suspicious, as we do not know each other well and have not had any sort of communication in the past, but I urge you to take my message very serious, considering the situation.Could you believe that the tradition and customs of the town and village where my late husband came from demands that any woman who does not have a male child for the husband, that whenever the husband dies, all the properties belonging to the late husband including cash will be shared among the late husband relatives and the woman will be sent out of the husband's house for good? My dear, this is exactly what I am going through right now since last month my husband died.His brothers had taken all the properties belonging to my late husband including Companies, Bank accounts and as well sent me and my little daughters out of his house just because I did not have a male child\nfor him.\nThis is a wicked tradition and culture that has no moral value. As I am talking to you now, I and my two daughters are going through hell at\nthe moment. But as God may have it, I'm having in my possession all the vital documents in relation to the deposited fund of the sum of\n$4.2 Million U.S Dollars - (FOUR MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS ONLY), he deposited in a bank in an ESCROW CALL ACCOUNT, here before his death.\nLast week I contacted the manager of the bank and he told me that the fund is much intact, that I can as well come for it any time I feel like. Please remember that I cannot make use of this fund here due to forces surrounding me at the moment, since I am regarded as a threat to my husband's brothers and they'd threatened to kill me.Please, have mercy at the poor widow like me and help out of this mess. All I want you to do for me is to assist me move this fund from its location now to a foreign land immediately before my late husbands relatives have knowledge of it and claim it just like they did to others. I strongly believe that the only way I can secure this fund is to act fast now and move it overseas, and remember it is only you and I who knows about this and should be treated as such. I need your assistance in the following ways:-\n(1) To help me stand as the next beneficiary of the fund and my late husband's foreign business partner.\n(2) To make arrangements for me and my two daughters to come over to your country to further their education.\nPlease note that you stand the chance to benefit from this transaction at the end, which percentage is negotiable. Remember also that my children are the source of my happiness and cannot stand and watch them go through such pains. You will be greatly rewarded and been entitled to a percentage of the proceeds from any investments I may venture into. I look forward to hearing from you soonest, so that we can commence on this, for with God all things are possible.\nBest Regards,\nJanet Kumah    "
