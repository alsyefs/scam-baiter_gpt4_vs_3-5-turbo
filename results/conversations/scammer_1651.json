        "body": "Dear Jacob Financial Services,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate your willingness to assist with the recovery of funds. However, I have a few questions before proceeding further.\n\n1. How exactly did Ecowas recover these funds? Can you provide more details about the process?\n\n2. What is the purpose of the suspense account in the prime bank? Why are the funds being held there?\n\n3. Are there any fees or charges involved in this process? If so, what are they and how are they calculated?\n\n4. Can you provide some examples or references of individuals or organizations that have successfully received their long overdue and unclaimed funds through your services?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nFilomena"
