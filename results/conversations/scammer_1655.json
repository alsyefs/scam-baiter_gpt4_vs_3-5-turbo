It's fascinating to learn about the steps being taken to resolve global banking issues.\n\nI'm curious, could you please elaborate more on how this process works? How does the committee identify victims of these banking practices? \n\nAlso, I'd love to know more about the role of the World Bank in this initiative. Are they directly involved in the payment release process or do they play a more supervisory role?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDennis"
