This you\r\nwill do by receiving this money from the bank where it's deposited and use\r\nit for humanitarian work.\r\nI have a lawyer here who will be of assistance in making sure this is\r\npossible.\r\nBasically, this is how I sincerely wish the Money be shared or disbursed on\r\nyour total supervision.\r\n\r\n(1) Give 10% of the money for general Miscellaneous and logistics, before ,\r\nduring and after the process.\r\n\r\n(2) Give 70% of the money to Charity organizations, Orphanage homes and\r\nChurches on my name so that my soul may rest in peace.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 20% should be for you and others that you would love to\r\nassist.\r\n\r\nUpon your full consideration and acceptance of this, kindly let me know so\r\nthat I can get the lawyer to begin immediately with the  legal documents\r\nfor this matter.\nRegards,\r\nMrs.  Velvet"
