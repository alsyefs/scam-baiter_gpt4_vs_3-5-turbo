        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprising message. I'm not aware of any ATM card that's been abandoned at Orlando Airport Florida USA. Also, I don't know any Mrs Caron Elizabeth and I certainly didn't direct anyone to claim anything on my behalf.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the misunderstanding but it seems like there's been some sort of mix-up. Could you please provide more details about this ATM card? How did it end up being abandoned at the airport? And how did my name get associated with it?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what exactly is the payment for? Is it for some kind of clearance fee or something else?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nHelen"
