The essence of this message is to reveal the secret which i had with my boss before his demise but i beg for your understanding.\nMy Boss deposited the sum of Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars in Vystar Credit Union a bank in America for investment purposes before his untimely death. As we cannot lay hands on the funds presently because of fear of government confiscation of the money, the bank manager has secretly instructed me to present a foreigner who will stand as a trustee partner to my late Boss or next of kin in order to transfer this money to him/her for safe keeping and investment purposes. You can invest this money in real estate or any profitable venture of your choice where I will have a fair share of the money.\nPlease indicate your interest by replying to me so that adequate modalities will be put in place for you to receive this money.\nI will be happy to get your response urgently as it is needed.\nYours Sincerely,\nJames Mordi.

A bank may ask for passport details as part of its\r\ncustomer due diligence process, which is the process of verifying the\r\nidentity of its customers.\r\n\r\nBy collecting passport details, the bank can verify the identity of its\r\ncustomers, ensuring that they are who they claim to be. The passport\r\ninformation helps the bank to match the customer's identity with\r\ngovernment-issued identification, which provides a high degree of\r\nconfidence that the customer is not involved in any illegal activities.\r\nAdditionally, passport information helps the bank to comply with the\r\nrequirements of international sanctions and to prevent transactions with\r\nindividuals and entities that are on sanctions lists.\r\n\r\nThe money involved is US$10.5 million and there is no fees require in\r\ncontacting the bank, it is free.If there is any fee required by the bank\r\nwhile discharging their remittance duties they will explain it better.What\r\nyou are asking again is what i have cleared in my last message but you are\r\na careful person. On that note if inclusion of Photocopy of your\r\nidentification card or int'l passport is your fear then skip it and send\r\nothers to me.Lastly i'm of convision that you have nothing to lose\r\nconcerning this deal.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you really want to contact the paying bank or not.Looking\r\nforward to seeing you coming up with a favourable decision.\r\n\nYours Sincerely,\r\nJames Mordi."

I suggest we\r\nget to the bank first and know their requirements as you are skeptical then\r\nif it is not what you can bear then i can look for a way out but i am only\r\nasking you to be courageous for us to seal this deal and have our money,\r\nplease fearless.\"If there would be fees in the course of remittance it will\r\nbe the bank that will explain it\" I mean that the bank is in a better\r\nposition to give us conditions or terms whether fees are needed or not. In\r\nmy previous email, if you may recall, I suggested that even if there will\r\nbe fees it will not exceed US$2000 but we have to wait and hear from the\r\nbank first.*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dear Mordi,Thank you for reaching out to me again. I appreciate your\r\npatience in explaining the situation further. I understand that the bank\r\nwill provide more information about any potential fees involved in the\r\nremittance process. It's good to know that even if there are fees, they\r\nwon't exceed a certain amount.Dear Mordi,Thank you for your response. I\r\nappreciate your reassurance that any fees associated with the remittance\r\nwill be explained by the bank. It's good to know that they will provide us\r\nwith the necessary information regarding any conditions or terms.Hello\r\nthere! Thank you for getting back to me so quickly. I appreciate the\r\ninformation you've shared so far. It's good to know that my identity will\r\nbe secured if I decide to proceed with this deal.About encryption\r\ntechnology used to safeguard our transactions and personal data?I am not a\r\nmajor in banking but i feel bank installs firewalls or hardwires that\r\nprevents hacker from gaining access into their customers data/accounts. I\r\nam of the feeling that you will ask me how it works to prevent hackers,\r\nplease note that any other questions about bank functions should be\r\ndirected to the bank not me. You will understand i have be patient trying\r\nto  convince you on this deal because i don't want this money confiscated\r\non thrown into government treasury as an unclaimed funds. But instead of\r\nyou not making any move and be asking me repeatedly on issues that have\r\nbeen cleared over and overdid suggest you step outside so that i can have\r\nsomeone very keen in handling the situation.Yours Sincerely,James Mordi.*"

        "body": "Dear James Mordi,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing your concerns about the encryption technology used by the bank. I understand that you are not well-versed in banking matters, but I can assure you that banks take the security of their customers' personal and financial information very seriously.\n\nTo explain how encryption technology works, it essentially involves encoding data in such a way that only authorized individuals or systems can access and decipher it. This ensures that even if someone were to intercept the data, they would not be able to make sense of it without the proper decryption key.\n\nIn terms of protecting against hacking attempts, banks employ multiple layers of security measures. These can include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, regular security audits, and constant monitoring of network activity. Additionally, banks often have dedicated teams that specialize in cybersecurity to stay ahead of potential threats.\n\nRegarding Mr. Gilbertha's experience with this encryption technology, it's great to hear that he had a successful run with it. However, it's important to note that individual experiences may vary and it's always wise to exercise caution when dealing with financial matters.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns about the encryption technology or any other aspect of the bank's security measures, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help!\n\nBest wishes,\nJudith"
