        "body": "A very Good Evening Alva\r\n\r\n\r\nYour mail response to my business proposal was received with the contents\r\nwell noted. I would like to reiterate that this transaction is a deal\r\nbetween you and I, and it should be kept very confidential. It is also 100%\r\nrisk free and a legitimate arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur company (Malaysia Oil Refinery Sdn Bhd) is a major crude oil buyer,\r\nwhich we buy, refine and sell to our end users both here in Asia, Europe\r\nand Singapore and in the Middle East. Right now, our company has an urgent\r\nneed for Libyan Crude oil from the National Oil Corporation, Libya which we\r\nare supposed to refine and supply to Europe, as you know there is a\r\nshortage of Fuel/ Petrol, Diesel and gas because of the war in Ukraine. The\r\nmandate is to buy 2 million barrels of Libyan crude oil monthly for the\r\nnext 12 months to meet our current demand for products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Oil Corporation, Libya does not sell their Crude Oil directly\r\nto buyers. They sell through their approved licensed agents who act as\r\nsales agents for their crude oil. The job/ duty of these sales agents\r\n(License Permit holders) are to source for buyers and ensure a smooth\r\npurchase transaction between the National Oil Corporation, Libya and the\r\nbuyers of their crude oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have approached you to obtain this License agent status/ License Permit\r\nholder with the National Oil Corporation, Libya to become their sales\r\nagent. Once you successfully acquire the License, I will bring our company\r\nto the table to pay/ buy the 2 million barrels monthly request from your\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nGetting this Crude Oil Lifting License Permit will give you the legal\r\nauthorization of the National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOCL) to become\r\ntheir sales agent. Acquiring this license is the most difficult part of\r\nthis venture because of the lucrative nature of the commissions paid to\r\nlicense owners every month,but not to worry I have put plans in place to\r\nmake sure you will be favorably considered once you apply for the license.\r\nI will guide you to apply for this license and once you obtain it, we have\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis entitles you to a commission gross of USD$4m to USD$6m monthly. I will\r\nuse my contact person/ Insider at NOC, Libya to ensure that the License\r\nPermit is granted to you swiftly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an employee of Malaysia Oil Refinery company, I'm not allowed to become\r\na license agent holder with National Oil Corporation, Libya. I have been\r\nmandated by our board of director to search for a license agent holder with\r\nNOC, Libya that our company can source Crude Oil from using his/ her Crude\r\nOil Lifting License Permit, the more reason I decided to contact you to get\r\nthe license and we work as partners to operate it and share the commission\r\namount/ fee to be paid to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are more details about this transaction and the role you are going to\r\nplay as the broker/mediator/ Sales Agent between our company Malaysia Oil\r\nRefinery Sdn Bhd and  National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC) , throughout\r\nthe duration of the purchase of Crude Oil from the  National Oil\r\nCorporation of Libya (NOC).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou will be corresponding between the National Oil Corporation of Libya\r\n(NOC) (Seller of the Crude Oil) and our Company Malaysia Oil Refinery Sdn\r\nBhd (buyer of Crude), this is a standard practice in the Oil Sector, some\r\ncompanies do not deal directly with the Sellers, they prefer to go through\r\na Middleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been mandated by our company , to initiate talks with the National\r\nOil Corporation of Libya (NOC) side for a 12 months contract of 2 million\r\nbarrels of crude oil per month, which I have concluded and all that is\r\nrequired now is a middle-man/ License permit holder to intermediate between\r\nour company and National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have an insider/ contact person at National Oil Corporation of Libya\r\n(NOC),who is a director and who advised me to present a neutral entity\r\n(individual or company) to be awarded a 1 year crude oil lifting contract\r\nwith them, then introduce this entity / person to our Company Malaysia Oil\r\nRefinery Sdn Bhd as the license holder for oil exporter from National Oil\r\nCorporation of Libya (NOC). This Individual who works for National Oil\r\nCorporation of Libya (NOC) is my silent partner in this transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe license holder will be entitled to a commission of USD$4m to USD$6m\r\nmonthly revenue from each 2 million barrels monthly shipment. I and my\r\npartner are willing to share 60%/40% with you if you agree to work with us\r\non this project. We will take 60% while you take 40%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am approaching retirement age. I need to set up a sustainable retirement\r\nplan for myself. We can either secure the Crude Oil license in your\r\npersonal name or your company name and from securing the license to\r\nreceiving our first commission will take a maximum period of 2 weeks. Let\r\nme know your position on this briefing ASAP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will direct and guide you step by step from the process of acquiring the\r\nlicense to become the broker/mediator to the process of selling your\r\nallocated product to our Company ( Malaysia Oil Refinery Sdn Bhd ).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will give you my phone/ WhatsApp number in my next communication after\r\ngetting your response. Please include your mobile phone numbers in your\r\nnext email so that I can give you a call for further discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI look forward to your next communication.\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEngr Yohan Blake\r\n\r\nProcurement Supervisor\r\n\r\nCrude Oil & Products Trading Division\r\n\r\nMalaysia oil Refinery Sdn Bhd"

        "body": "Dear Alva,\r\n\r\nYes, it’s quite a detailed, straightforward process. I believe that you\r\nhave read and understand my previous email and to answer to your question\r\n(1) the oil license application letter is just a simple letter of enquiries\r\nto the Director License Department National Oil Corporation of Libya\r\nrequesting the requirement to apply for oil license, which I will draft out\r\nto you and you will send to the NOC and nothing more. Like I said, I will\r\nguide you step by step so you do not need to worry. (2) The NOC is the\r\nseller of the crude oil and only deals with buyers through their approved\r\nlicense holder and that is where you come in. (3) As soon as the license is\r\napproved in your favor, thereafter the sales and purchasing agreement is\r\nsigned between both parties. The buyers will wire a USD$500,000.00\r\nmobilization fee for the vessels hiring and logistics or more depending on\r\nthe contract.\r\n\r\nMr. Alva, Let's follow the process and I think the most important thing\r\nthat we need to worry about now is the payment of the license fee which I\r\ndon’t mind. I will share the cost with you once the license is issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI’m not supposed to release confidential information but this is the length\r\nI can go for now until you provide me with your phone number, this is a\r\nmulti-million business and I cannot go further without speaking with you\r\nover the phone.\r\n\r\nHere is my number + 60 11 1722 51 27\nRegards,\r\nEngr Yohan Blake\r\nProcurement Supervisor\r\nIndependent Feasibility/Project Management Consultant\r\nCrude Oil &amp; Products Trading Division\r\nAsia Oil Refinery Sdn Bhd"
