I must say, it's quite an honor to be selected in such a manner by the World Oil and Gas Executive board, United Nations, World Bank Monetary Fund IMF, and other esteemed organizations.\n\nI'm a bit confused about how my name was chosen for this opportunity. Could you please explain the selection process? Also, what does 'retrieved and full sum' mean in this context?\n\nYou mentioned that my payment would be reserved for FIVE working days. What happens if I am unable to respond within this timeframe?\n\nRegarding the payment methods - ATM card or bank transfer - could you provide more information on how these work? For instance, how would I receive an ATM card and how can I use it? And if I choose bank transfer, what are the steps involved?\n\nI appreciate your patience in answering my questions. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
