        "body": "Hello Mr Chris,\r\nGood sir and thanks for the reply.\r\nNo.1, Sir when you contact the Indian local-based dealer of the product and\r\nmade an inquiry of the product availability in stock ,I believe they will\r\nforward to you the product quotation/specification, therein you will\r\nunderstand better about the natural herbal /roots components of Epokoh\r\nroots product.\r\n\r\nNo.2, The product is not used for production of vaccines and feed\r\nsupplements sir, rather our company uses the product to mix vaccines for\r\nprocurement of feed supplements/treatment of pet animals and some other\r\nagricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nNo.3, Here are the local-based dealer of the product contact details :\r\nName: Ram Traders.\r\nContact person: Arya Ram Singh\r\nMob. number: +919987527971\r\nE-mail: contact@asiaundpprogram.org ( or ) ramtraders388@gmail.com\r\nWebsite: www.asiaundpprogram.org\r\nAddress:36A Garden City Anil Badhwa Industrial Estate Bareilly Uttar\r\nPradesh 243122 India.\r\n\r\nYou can contact them and make inquiry if the product is available in stock,\r\ntheir current price per gallon of 5 liters container and procedures to\r\ndeliver the product locally in India upon order because they usually\r\ntransact FoB, And they're reputable dealers/suppliers by all standards. Of\r\ncourse I am sure they've been in business for a long time, I can assure you\r\n100% that we are dealing with reliable partners.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, how the profit sharing would work is that if after convincing\r\nour company that you're the main supplier of the product in India, our\r\ncompany wires up to 70 to 80 Percent of the total cost of quantity ordered\r\nfrom you as initial or down payment to product and supply the product, when\r\nthe product is ready for delivery as will be confirmed by the company's\r\npurchasing manager who will also fly and meet with you in India, the\r\nbalance payment will be transferred to your account, received and confirmed\r\nby your bank, then you deliver the product to the purchasing manager there\r\nin India and he makes the shipment down to our country.\r\n\r\nSo at the close of the transaction, i mean when you've delivered the\r\nproduct, the profit margin will be shared 70% for you and 30% for me and we\r\nwait for another order in three months which i will communicate with you.\r\n\r\nNormally there's not much expenses you will incur as the supplier, But for\r\nclarity sake if you're not in India i think it's necessary and important\r\nyou will travel to India after successful signing the supply contract with\r\nour company and probably our company may request for the product sample for\r\ntesting of product quality before wiring the advance payment of the\r\nquantity ordered, the company sometimes instructs the purchasing manager to\r\nhave a sample of the product from you upon meeting with you in India as the\r\nsupplier, Then you will provide the sample for his testing of quality in\r\nyour presence and confirms the test result to you and our company, if the\r\nquality after testing proves satisfactory according to the company's\r\nstandard, the company will immediately make an advance or down payment as i\r\nstated above while the purchasing manager waits to take delivery when it's\r\nready.\r\n\r\nSo what you will do is immediately you receive the advance payment, you\r\nquickly transfer payment to the local dealer for the same quantity\r\naccording to their price quote and wait for the delivery there in India,\r\nonce it is delivered to you then you inform the company's purchasing\r\nmanager and your balance will be paid and he takes over the product, that's\r\nall. This transaction could be transacted and completed in just 2 weeks and\r\neveryone will be happy.\r\n\r\nI hope this answers will help and put you in the right direction to proceed\r\nwith the transaction accordingly, if you do have any other question you can\r\nkindly forward your question where you're not cleared to enable me to\r\nprovide you with the notable answer to proceed. Thank you and God bless.\r\nKindly provide me with your contact phone number to enable us to\r\ncommunicate effectively.\r\nHave a great weekend with your family.\r\nRegards.\r\nMr Kenneth Owusuh. contact phone number...+233246685790"
