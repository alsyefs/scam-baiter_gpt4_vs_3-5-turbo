I must admit, I am a bit confused about the situation you mentioned regarding Sarah Johnson claiming that the funds belong to her. I have never heard of this person before and I certainly did not send her to claim any funds on my behalf.\n\nCould you please provide more details about how she contacted you and what information she provided? It is important for me to understand the full picture before taking any further action.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what deed you are referring to?
