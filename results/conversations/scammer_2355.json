        "body": "Hello Lisa,\n\nThank you for your interest and enthusiasm. The United Nations has indeed initiated this program as a part of their global poverty alleviation efforts. The recipients were chosen through a random selection process from a pool of internet users worldwide.\n\nAs for the shipping handling fee, it is necessary to cover the costs associated with packaging, courier services, and insurance. This ensures that your ATM CARD reaches you safely and securely. Your card will be shipped from our main office located in New York.\n\nI hope this clarifies your queries. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\nBest wishes,\nLisa"
