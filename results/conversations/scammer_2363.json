        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information. I'm quite flattered by the attention my case is receiving. \n\nI must say, this all sounds very exciting! The idea of receiving such a large sum is almost overwhelming. However, I do have a few questions before we proceed further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain more about the Foreign Transfer Code? What exactly is it and why is it necessary for the transfer?\n\nSecondly, regarding the payment options, could you provide more details about how each one works? For example, if I choose the Bank Wire Transfer option, what would be the process? And similarly for the ATM Visa Card option?\n\nLastly, could you tell me more about DHL Courier Company? How reliable are they and how long would it take for them to deliver the ATM Visa Card to my address?\n\nI look forward to your response. Thank you once again for your time and assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nDebra"
