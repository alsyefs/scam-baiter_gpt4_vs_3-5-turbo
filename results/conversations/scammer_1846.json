It must be challenging being in Syria right now, especially with the situation you've described. I appreciate your trust in me and I'm willing to help in any way that I can.\n\nHowever, before we proceed further, could you please provide more information about this process? For instance, how did you manage to secure such a large sum of money from the United Nations Oil for food program? Also, why is it necessary for the funds to be moved out of Syria?\n\nI understand that due to security reasons you cannot use a phone but is there any other way we can verify this transaction? Maybe through an official channel or a third party?\n\nAs for me, well, I lead a simple life. I am not married and don't have any children. My work involves managing a small grocery store in my town. It's not much but it keeps me busy and helps pay the bills.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDebra"

I really understand what it takes to accumulate such huge amount of funds under your care, for this reason, I am willing to share it equal as I am not a greedy person and hence my dad and mom are dead and am the only child.so as it stands right now you represent my prospect partner because this deal is what we do together but please make sure that my share is well secured until I complete my service here and come over to meet with you.\r\n\r\nKnow that I am free with you because I have trusted you with all my heart in this deal. So please do not let me down. You may not understand why I am doing this but I know even if I passed away, your prayer and the prayer of the orphanage will secure me a place in paradise.\r\n\r\nAnd remember they don't know the content of the safe boxes except me and you. It's a top secret.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the Delivery Company Details to contact them now\r\n\r\nATLANTIC DIPLOMATIC COMPANY TURKEY\r\nAddress : Embassy Diplomatic Section\r\nEmail : Atlanticdiplomatic@diplomats.com\r\nWebsite : www.atlanticsecuritycompany.com\r\nOperational Manager : Mr. Robert Belto"
