It's great to hear from the US Bank Online and I appreciate the guarantee provided by the General Manager and Treasury Department IMF.\n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts of your message though. Could you please clarify what exactly this charge is for? And why do I need to purchase a steam wallet card or gift card from an Apple store?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about how the online banking system works? How secure is it and what measures are in place to protect my funds during transfer?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBeverly"
