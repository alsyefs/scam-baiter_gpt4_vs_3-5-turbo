        "body": "Hello Vanessa,\r\n\r\nYou acknowledged my detailed explanation yet you are a bit confused\r\nabout some parts of my email and I ask how confused again?\r\n\r\nWaiver in general terms; A waiver is the voluntary relinquishment or\r\nsurrender of some known right or privilege. Regulatory agencies of\r\nstate departments or the federal government may issue waivers to\r\nexempt companies from certain regulations.\r\n\r\nIn this context, waiver here means that both government and bank have\r\nsurrendered all payments due them before you receive the fund till\r\nafter you receive it. Why you need to pay a fee for it is because\r\nwaiver can only be effective and legally binding once notarized by a\r\ncourt of competent jurisdiction and in this context, the supreme court\r\nhas the jurisdiction to notarize.\r\n\r\nRegarding payment methods, what payment method are you familiar with\r\nif you are not familiar with bank transfers or Western Union money?\r\n\r\nAgain, you have not forwarded your personal details as requested for\r\nfinal verification."
