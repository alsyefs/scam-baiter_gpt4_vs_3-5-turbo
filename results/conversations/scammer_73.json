The IMF rolled out this program to repay victims of all sort of scam.\nThis transaction will cost no headache or lavish spending because a fiduciary has been nominated to stand as a trustee between you and the bank during the course of this transaction. The main reason why a trustee is hired is to secure and retrieve your fund payment without hitches.\nThe fiduciary service charge cannot be more than US$50,000 and will only be paid to him once you receive and confirm your payment to your bank account.\nEmail me:- \naivafinance@hotmail.com\n IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE FIDUCIARY SO THAT I CAN EMAIL YOU HIS CONTACTS.\nYours Truly,\nRebecca Hall\nCEO\nAIVA Finance Inc"
