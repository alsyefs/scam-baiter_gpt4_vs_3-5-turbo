The ATM Smart Card method seems very convenient indeed.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that the payment will be sent in batches of million dollars - could you please clarify how many batches there will be and when I can expect each one?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the UPS or FedEx delivery? How long does it usually take for the card to arrive once it's dispatched? And is there any way to track its progress?\n\nLastly, I'd love to know more about this project that I must be conscious of. What exactly does it involve?\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nLeslie"
