        "body": "  The European Central Bank \nKaiserstrasse 29 Eurotower \nFrankfurt am Main, 60311 Germany\nThis is to inform you that your fund of Seventy Million United States Dollars in your name has been abandoned with our Eurosystem check clearance for months by the depositor (SWIFT) because of the official clearance process of the check. As the prime component of the Eurosystem of the European System of Central Banks, we want to confirm your actual position on the fund before the confiscation since the clearance has been pending for months. This is the Governing Council's monetary policy decision today because of the profound implications of abandoning such a fund. Confirmation of your position on this fund is very important to help us contribute to the safety and soundness of the European banking system.\nThis is the most important instruction to ensure that your money is wired directly to your designated bank account or stays safe in the European System of Central Banks. You will apply for a European Union Fund Clearance Deduction Certificate. We call it general law or principleâ€”the official authority to deduct or subtract from your fund to clear your fund. Upon your reply to this message, I will forward the application document to process the official deduction permit. When funds are withheld from clearance, we will officially deduct them from the capital fund to clear them to avoid any delay. This is called authorization to deduct.\nI, therefore, have every confidence that you will get back to us to avoid confiscation of this fund. We are waiting for your urgent confirmation of this important message before we will give you the full details and open full communications\nMrs. Christine Lagarde\nPresident: European Central Bank \nHeadquarters: Frankfurt, Germany   "
