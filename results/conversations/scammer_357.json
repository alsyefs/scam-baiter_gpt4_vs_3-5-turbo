You have suffered for nothing without receiving your fund due to over greediness of our bank Director that lead for his sacking. You would have received your fund since your last payment but your problem is over greediness of your representative that cost you a lot of money and still yet, you have never received $1 into your account.\nYour total money US$10,500 000.00 has been deposited with the bank department, this is very secret information and I’m expecting your urgent response before I can give you more details and the direct contact information of the bank. There is two directors that wanted to divert your payment to another bank, you are just paying all the money as charges for nothing.\nListen very carefully, I’m giving you this information secretly and I want you to keep it very secret. If you have received your money US$10,500 000.00, let me know but if you did not receive your fund, reply me through email urgently.\nI am waiting for your response.\nThanks!\nPaul Smith   "

Could you explain why there are charges involved in receiving my fund? I would like to understand the reason behind these charges.\r\nBefore you can get this fund transferred to you, you will need to upgrade your file every month, that is why you have not gotten anything since then, if you are ready to work with me, you will have to show me a proof that you are rightful beneficiary of this said fund and will follow all my instructions from me.\nThanks\r\n\r\nPual Smith"
