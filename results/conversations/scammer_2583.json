I am 75 years old and was diagnosed with cancer about four years ago, shortly after the death of my husband. I have been touched to donate from what I have inherited from my late husband for the good of humanity rather than allow his relatives to lavish my husband's hard earned money. As I lay on my sick bed, I want you to help me in carrying out my last wish on earth which will also be very profitable to you. I want to WILL a total sum of $5.5 million USD to you which I want you to distribute part of it to any charity home for me and the rest for yourself and your family.\nI pray the good lord touches your heart to get back to me on this important humanitarian work.\nI look forward to your reply.\n \nBest regards,\nMrs. Olivia Grace.

        "body": "Greetings, Dear Beloved brother Frank.\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for your kind consideration.\r\nI am Mrs. Olivia Grace , I am 67 years old, But I am currently living in\r\nThailand where I am undergoing medical treatment for throat cancer which\r\nunfortunately has spread to my lymph nodes and some other parts of my body.\r\nI was married to Late Mr. Van Kersber from California who died four years\r\nago, and I inherited the family's business, my husband and I were married\r\nfor 17 years without a child, so I am childless and have no one to inherit\r\nmy estate when I am gone. I prayed to God asking him for direction on who\r\nto donate the funds to before contacting you, and I want you to know that I\r\nam not asking you for any money, rather I seek for your trust and honesty\r\nin distributing the donation money to poor Children like motherless,\r\ndestitute homeless people. I have also donated to charity organizations in\r\nThailand, Africa and South American countries, but this time I want to\r\ndonate the sum of, ( a total sum of $5.5 million USD) to you as an\r\nindividual to help distribute it to the homeless children and destitute\r\naround you.\r\n\r\nRecently, My health has deteriorated, and my doctors have informed me that\r\nI have a few months to live, and as a result of shock, I was hit by a\r\npartial stroke, which affected my ability to walk, talk or do anything on\r\nmy own. Having known my condition I decided to search for a God Fearing\r\nindividual whom I can (WILL/DONATE) the funds to enable him/her utilize\r\nthis money the way I am going to instruct here. I want an individual that\r\nwill use this money to help the poor in the religious houses, orphanage\r\nhomes, widows and the destitute. I took the decision to donate this money\r\nto you because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money, and\r\nconsidering my ill health, I had no choice but to give the money out for\r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\n\r\nI sincerely request for your assistance in this humanitarian work. I will\r\nsend a funds transfer request letter to my bank instructing them to\r\ntransfer the total sum of Five Million, five Hundred Thousand Dollars into\r\nyour bank account, then you will use Four Million, Five Hundred Thousand\r\nUnited States Dollars to help the following people: Motherless babies,\r\nWidows, Disable and the destitute, Helping the poor in religious houses.\r\nThe remaining One Million United States Dollars will be for you as a reward\r\nfor your good work, and I need you to promise me that you will sincerely\r\nuse the money as I mentioned above to carry out the humanitarian project.\r\nNote that there are no risks involved because my late husband acquired the\r\nmoney through legal means, and the donations funds transfer process will be\r\nfollowed legally.\r\n\r\nPresently I am taking treatments at the Isolated specialist cancer hospital\r\nhere in Bangkok, Thailand. I don’t know how long I will be alive, but I am\r\npraying that God should help me.  I am very weak these days and talk very\r\nslowly. I write emails with the help of my assigned lady nurse here Ms. Kim\r\nChan. She is a trusted lady whom I have known in recent years, she is the\r\nperson that helps me access and write emails, sometimes responding to your\r\nemails might be difficult if she's unavailable. I promised God that all my\r\ndonations will be done quietly without any publicity, kindly respect my\r\nwish and handle the whole process confidential, as I do not want any\r\npraises from anyone.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I hear from you, I will give you further details on what you are\r\nrequired to provide to enable the funds transfer to your bank account.\r\n\r\nMay the almighty God bless you.\r\n\nBest regards.\r\nMrs. Olivia Grace"
