It may interest you to know that reports have reached our office through so many correspondences on the uneasy way in which people like you are treated by various banks and payment officials across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the USA. We have decided to put a stop to that. All government and non-government entities, NGOs, finance companies, banks, security companies, and courier companies that have been in contact with you of late have been instructed to back off from your transaction, and you have been advised not to respond to them anymore since the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is now directly in charge of your payment.\nYour name appeared in our payment schedule list of beneficiaries that will receive their funds in 2024. Your payment fund is USD 18.3 million; this also includes the generated interest so far.\nRe-confirm your full name, home address, and cell phone number.\nKindly get back to me for more detailed information.\nMrs. Mary Anderson\nDebt recovery department\nInternational Monetary Fund\nLondon, England."
