I am 75 years old and was diagnosed for cancer about four years ago, immediately after the death of my husband .I have been touched to donate\n \nfrom what I have inherited from my late husband for the good work rather than allow his relatives to lavish my husband's hard earned fund. As I lay on my sick bed, I want you to help me in carrying out my last wish on earth which will also be very profitable to you. I want to WILL a total sum of $5.5 million USD to you which I want you to\n \ndistribute part of it to any charity home for me and the rest for yourself and your family, I will inform you on how to share all\nPlease kindly click the reply and get back to me.  \n \nBest regards,\nMrs. Olivia Grace.

        "body": "My Dearest in the lord,\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your concern. I also thank you for your urgent reply,\r\nyou're such a nice person I really need in this project. Like I mentioned,\r\nthe amount involved I want us to use part of it for charity and the other\r\nyou can invest it in lucrative business for the benefit of the charity and\r\nalso for yourself.\r\n\r\nI found most African charity foundations for less privileges are owned and\r\nestablished to enrich the owners, hundreds of millions are donated to these\r\nhomes but still the children in those homes are not well taken care of. The\r\nrich now make deals with them to escape taxes by making false donations.\r\nThis is the main reason why my late husband and I want to establish a\r\ncharity foundation of our own and to make sure that the money is used for\r\nthe purpose it was meant for.\r\n\r\nI was brought up in a motherless baby's home. My late husband and I were\r\nmarried for thirty five years without a child. You might also be wondering\r\nwhy I canâ€™t delegate this task to any of my husband's relatives. My\r\nfamilies and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness\r\nand I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to\r\nany of them anymore. I cannot also let this wealth be without stating any\r\nbeneficiary, that will make it go back to already corrupt rich governments\r\nwith millions of less privileged children in the society praying everyday\r\nto be touched by someone to remember them.\r\n\r\nMy dear, please try to understand my situation and carry out this project\r\nwith me immediately. The decision making on how to use the fund will be\r\ntotally yours, you can build a school or safe house in your own country for\r\nthe less privileged around you. You can develop our already registered\r\ncharity foundation name here in South Africa if you choose to do it in\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThere are no strings attached to this proposal. I am just a sick dying\r\nwoman who wishes to make a positive impact on humanity through your\r\nassistance. You are welcome to fly down to South Africa to witness the\r\ntransfer processes  and also to meet me. However, if you are not able to\r\ncome down to South Africa at this time because of the COVID-19 Disease we\r\ncan as well carry on with the fund transfer by bank wire transfer to any of\r\nyour private or company bank accounts in your country.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your readiness to proceed with the transfer either by\r\ncoming down to South Africa or do you want wire transfer.\r\n\nWarm Regards,\r\nOlivia Grace"
