        "body": "Greetings, Please let this not sound strange to you because I am not asking you for money, for my only surviving lawyer who would have done this, died early this year. I prayed and got your email address from your country's guest book which I got from my late husband's archive and I wish to visit once more if God will in his infinite mercies grant me.\nI want to solicit your assistance in the discharge of my Will. I am Mrs. Sally Mae Traversie, \nfrom the United States\n and I am aged 68 years suffering from endometrial cancer. Please, I want you to help me create a charitable project with the money that I inherited from my deceased husband Mr. Alfred Earl Traversie who died in a motor accident. I was brought up from a motherless baby's home and was married to my late husband for twenty nine years without a child.\nMy friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my illness and I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them anymore, so I sold all my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of 9,000,000.00 USD (Nine Million United States Dollars) with my bank. All I need is an honest person who will use at least %60 of the funds as I would instruct, then the rest %40 will go to you for helping me accomplish this mission because donating this money to charity is the only legacy I can leave behind after my death. No money is required from you to carry on with this project because it is my heart's desire to make a generous gift to you to work for a charity in your country. I don't mind if you are a Christian or Muslim or Hindu or Buddhist. Rather, my only paramount concern here is whether I can trust you because this generation is filled up with greedy and fraudulent people all over the world. I will give you more details as soon as I hear from you.\nLooking forward to your urgent response.\nKind regards.\nMrs. Sally Mae Traversie"

It's admirable that you want to leave a legacy through charity, and it's unfortunate that you've had such experiences with people around you.\n\nYou mentioned a charitable project that you'd like me to assist with. Could you please provide more details about this project? What kind of charity are we talking about here? Is there a specific cause or group of people that you're particularly interested in helping?\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about how the funds will be transferred and managed. You mentioned that no money is required from me, which is good because I don't have much to spare. But I'm curious as to how this process will work.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nHenry"

Thank you for your reply, i am sorry for the late response from me and it was because my doctor asked me not to stress my body due to my health. I want you to send me your name, home address and phone number so that I can send an application letter to the bank along with your information for them to commence with the transfer. You don't have to worry about the authenticity of this project, you can inform your lawyer to guide you through the transfer process without any fear of breaking the law. I have instructed the bank manager and they will work with you and your lawyer to make sure that the transfer is completed according to the laws,  and also for the purpose of the funds. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\r\n\nYours Faithfully,\r\nMrs. Sally Mae Traversie"
