This compensation fund was allocated to you by our government\r\nbecause a UK establishment was used for the scam attempt on your person\r\nthat might have caused you so much pain in the past according to the\r\nrecords available to us. On behalf of the UK government, we sincerely\r\napologize for all the inconveniences this might have caused you.\r\n\r\nBecause of the bottleneck associated with your transaction in the past,\r\nthis is to inform you that I have made a special arrangement with a\r\nfinancier consultant who specializes in financial transactions. I have\r\ndiscussed with him very well and he is going to make this transaction very\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nI will like you to contact him directly and follow all the instruction from\r\nhim so that you will receive this money\r\n\r\nWe recommend you contact the nominated Financial Consultant below, who has\r\nyears of experience in financial matters.\r\n\r\nFinancial Consultant’s details;-\r\n\r\nAttention; Dr. Mack Wilson\r\n\r\nEmail: info@financials-consultant.com\r\n\r\nPlease email to the consultant a copy of our correspondence for his perusal.\r\n\r\nAs stated earlier, because of the bottlenecks experienced by you in the\r\npast as a result of the Bank procedures and processes in transferring your\r\nfunds thereby defrauding you in the process, we had extensive discussion\r\nwith a reputable forex company in the USA called Fab Trades Broker to\r\nfacilitate the release of your funds.\r\n\r\nThere are no legal ramifications with your involvement in the claim\r\nprocess, just you know.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\n\nRoger Pratt"
