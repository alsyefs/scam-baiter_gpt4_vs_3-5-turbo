It's unfortunate that there are people out there who try to deceive others.\n\nTo answer your questions, no, I have not met any scammers in person. As for the amount I paid them, I'm afraid I don't have an exact figure as it was spread out over multiple transactions. However, it was a significant sum of money. I did not travel to any country to meet with them either.\n\nRegarding their contact details, I do not have any valid information as they provided me with fake names, addresses, and phone numbers. It's quite frustrating that they were so deceptive.\n\nAs for evidence of payment, unfortunately, I do not have any tangible proof as most of the transactions were done through unconventional means such as wire transfers and cryptocurrency.\n\nI hope this information helps with your collective security review. If there's anything else you need from me or if you have any advice on how to proceed legally in recovering my funds, please let me know.\n\nThank you again for your assistance.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
