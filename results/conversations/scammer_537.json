You will be receiving your funds from this office any moment from now. We shall keep a document report of every transaction done here in the USA. Investigations gathered by the Fund Regulatory Agency {IMF}, I know you will be expecting to hear from me regarding this delivery after the last attempt to get it over. The fact is that I understand you're been into so many transactions and I decided to stay clear so that you will understand the truth about everything going on the internet.\n \nIn a more proper and legalized manner, the Fund Reconciliation Department and the Federal Reserve Bank solicited us to allow your fund to be written as a Cashier's Check or Credited as an ATM Visa Card and have it shipped to your home address through USPS Priority Mail Express today. This option is considered to be the best, easiest and the most efficient way to have your long awaited United Nations approved funds.\n \nFor the purpose of avoiding double payment on your end, we had an agreement with the IMF and the Federal Reserve Bank to document every charge necessary until your funds worth $4.5 million USD get to you. The analytical group of the two offices mentioned above estimated an accurate sum of US$150.00 as the Fund Release Order Certificate. So it was constituted and officially submitted to the Court of Justice that \n“the only” charge you will ever pay before your package leaves our office here in USA is only US$150.00 which is the fee for your Procurement File to be signed and sent to us here after which you'll never spend a dime again.\nWe are a renowned and reputable USA Agency and we don't like undocumented processes. This is why it has to be written down on paper that you will never pay any other money. The US$150.00 is for \"FUND RELEASE ORDER CERTIFICATE\". The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will be coming to this office, so they will have the Power of Attorney to stand in and sign on your behalf and bring along with your Procurement File to us here to enable us post your loaded ATM Card/Check to your mailing address without any hitch.\n \nIn this transaction, we need to let you know that the days of you being subject to paying fees after fees are over, Thank God that your fund is here in New York, USA. decided to follow the USA constitutions so as to ensure that your money is in your hands without any missing words, it will be desirable if you consciously adhere to the above instruction by remitting the Fund Release Order Certificate is calculated to be US$150.00.\n \nOnce again , we are sorry for the inconveniences you might have encountered in the past, in pursuit of your funds. Now that this office, Fund Reconciliation Department, is involved, you will have no cause to ever regret again as soon as you adhere to the above given instructions.\nFinally, \nyou are required to make the administrative payment of $150 by simply going and  buying any of the following Gift Cards; Apple Gift Card, Steam Wallet or  i Tune Gift Card.\n \n      Regards,\nMr. David Hamzat\nYours Sincerely,\nEmail; \ndeliveryagent@collector.org\nDirector Of The Communication IRS Commissioner,"
