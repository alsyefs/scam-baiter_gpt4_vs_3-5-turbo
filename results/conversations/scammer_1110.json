        "body": "Hello Mr. David Phillipson,\n\nThank you for your detailed response. I appreciate the information about the Letter Of Intent (LOI) and the Tank Storage Agreements (TSA). It's great to hear that your leasing terms and rental rates are good, and that discounts are available for longer bookings.\n\nCould you please clarify a few things for me? When you mention that initial payments for TSA are done by lessee management to your nominated bank account, could you explain how this process works? Also, what does the activation process involve?\n\nRegarding the refund policy, it's reassuring to know that refunds will be handled by your finance unit without penalties or fees. Could you provide more details on how this process is carried out?\n\nLastly, could you guide me on how to submit my LOI? Is there a specific format or any particular details I need to include?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJeanne"

        "body": "Dear Jeanne,\r\n\r\n  Thanks for your mail, it was well received.\r\n\r\nFor clarification and answers to your questions, below are answers.\r\n\r\n1. Initial Payments are done by lessee management, for the activation of \r\ntheir TSA and having tank reservation with us. This will enable us to \r\nissue a valid Tank Storage Receipt TSR, with details of the tank space \r\nassigned to your company. Initial number of days in accordance with TSA \r\nissuance is between 3-6 days of reservation.\r\n\r\n2. We are very committed to our refund policy as in TSA. Once lessee \r\ndecides not to make use of the reserved tank space, the refund of tank \r\nfees payment would be done by our finance unit, upon having the \r\nconfirmation and receiving account details from the Lessee management. \r\nReceiving your refund notice, it will take our finance unit 72 hours to \r\nhave the refund perfected.\r\n\r\n3. Submitting your LOI is very simple. Inform us of the product name and \r\nquantity to be stored. Also, lessee management is to state their full \r\ncompany details, to enable our management draft the official Tank \r\nStorage Agreement TSA document.\r\n\r\nHope this is well understood.\r\n\r\nDo submit your LOI to proceed.\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nMr. David Phillipson\r\nManager (Storage)\r\n+1-432-268-8837 WhatsApp\r\nOn Behalf of DIAMOND A TANK FARM LLC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\nDIAMOND A TANK FARM LLC"

It's quite enlightening to learn about the process involved in leasing a tank space with DIAMOND TANK FARM LLC.\n\nI'm curious, what is the minimum and maximum quantity of product that can be stored in a single tank?
